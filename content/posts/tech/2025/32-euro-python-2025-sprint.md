Finally back from EuroPython and recovering a bit from the long travel.
It's time to review how the development sprint went this time.

<!--more-->

This is what the EuroPython organizers asked us after the sprint. (PyCon TW might want to consider doing something similar ðŸ¤”)

- how many participants you had;
- how many issues were tackled; and
- how many PRs you merged?

and the answers are

1. around 8
2. 2
3. 1

This time, we spent a lot of time setting up Breeze and faced many unexpected issues that we couldn't resolve quickly. This is the first time the environment setup has taken us so long. During DurianPy, the setup went quite smoothly. ðŸ¤”

After completing the setup, I dedicated most of my time to triaging and checking whether there were simple, easy-to-address issues we could work on.

It's not as productive as I would have expected this time. Nonetheless, helping new friends take their first steps toward open source remains a meaningful experience.

Plus, the food was really good
