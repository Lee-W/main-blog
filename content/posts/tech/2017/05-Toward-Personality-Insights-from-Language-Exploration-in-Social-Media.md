The main purpose of this paper is to show how social media can be used to gain psychological insights.

Different from other papers in the past which use a pre-compiled word category list (e.g. LIWC),
it uses an open vocabulary approach that allowing discovery of unanticipated language.

### Data

* 75,000 Volunteers
    * Facebook Status Update
    * Age
    * Gender
    * Personality (Through Standard Personality Questionnaire)

### Architecture

1. Linguistic Feature Extraction
    * N-Gram
        * Point-Wise Mutual Information
    * Topic
        * Probability a person mentioning a topic (Derived from LDA)
2. Correlation analysis
    * Least Squares Linear Regression
3. Visualization
    * [Differential Word Clouds](http://wwbp.org/personality_wc.html)
        * Word size represents correlation strength.
        * Color represents relative frequency
    * Standardized Frequency Plot
        * Plot the word frequency against age

### Result

Most results confirm what is already known or obvious.
However, I think this method might still be useful to gain insight in other kinds of datasets.
