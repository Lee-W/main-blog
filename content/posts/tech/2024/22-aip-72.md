[TOC]

## 前言
AIP 的全名是 [Airflow Improvement Proposals][AIP]
顧名思義，跟 Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 差不多
就是讓 Airflow 變得更好的提案

最近開發 [AIP-75] 的功能發現，有些 AIP 的內容我看過又忘了
不小心又問了蠢問題
正如同我部落個現在的標題 "Those aren't written down are meant to be forgotten"
沒寫下來的東西，最終都會忘記的
那就來做個筆記吧

系列名「帶我讀 AIP」當然是捏他 COSCUP 的「帶您讀源碼」
你也許會問，那不是應該要是「帶您讀 AIP」嗎？
這問題問得好
因為這是寫給我自己的筆記
不過如果剛好對你有幫助的話就太好了 😇
讀起來應該就跟我的書摘系列差不多

最近要開始做 [Move Asset user-facing components to task_sdk #43619][airflow-issue-43619]
把 [AIP-74] 所改名的 Asset 的相關東西移動到 [AIP-72] 所提出的 TaskSDK
所以這系列的文章就從 [AIP-72] 開始了

### Definitions
* Airflow Core: the scheduler and API servers
* User code: DAG files, but not necessarily plugins

### Motivation
* Reduces the interaction between the Task (user code) and Airflow Core → **Airflow Core and Task can be upgraded separately**
* Avoid workers/tasks to Airflow DB access while still being able to get the information required → task executions on local, trusted networks
* Interface for remote workers to connect to Airflow Core service for information needed for task execution → better remote execution
* Language agnostic interface → **allowing Tasks in other languages**
    * **DAGs will still be Python-based**

### Changes to make
* No extra components outside of Airflow and its metadata DB should be needed to run Airflow locally

#### Disable Direct DB access
* Remove direct DB access from
    * user code
    * workers
    * triggerers
    * triggers
* **All DB traffic goes through an API server**
    * reduce the number of open connections to DB

#### Build a new API for task communication from the ground up
* Endpoints for all items in the "Airflow Task SDK"
* Strongly versioned using **CalVer**
* Supports WebSockets or other "instant" push for low-latency
    * in practice, Async web framework (e.g., FastAPI)
* Transport encoding: TBD

#### API security and Strong per-task-try identity
* Strong identity for each **task try** ← authorization
    * current choice: JWT token signed by the API server

#### Define an "Airflow Task SDK"
* Interface for
    * Version introspection
    * Airflow Connections
    * Variables
    * Read and write
        * XCom
        * Triggers
    * heartbeat
    * logs
    * metrics
    * OpenLineage events
    * data about task expansion for downstream tasks
        * values
        * lengths
        * names
        * etc.
    * etc.
* Access to the Connections and Variables (detail TBD)
* Read/Write task log or XCom
    * consideration point
        * avoid requiring every log line for every task execution to go over the API server due to performance
        * solution TBD
* Out of scope
    * handling custom callbacks

#### Extend Executor interface
* Replace ~~`queue_task_instance()`, `queue_command()`, `send_callback()`~~ with `queue_activity()`

```python
def queue_activity(
    self,
    *,
    # For now just "ExecuteTask", "RunCallback", but allows for "ParseDAGFile" etc. in future
    kind: ActivityType,
    # Contains TI for "ExecuteTask", so executor can get ti.queue out of this.
    context: dict[str, Any],
): ...
```

* Key difference: what's passed between the scheduler and worker
    * from ~~commands to run~~ to *better typed parameters*

```json
{
  "kind": "ExecuteTask",
  "token": "eyJhb....",
  "id": [ "dag_id", "task_id", "run_id", "attempt", "map_index"], # Or better, a single id, but we want these details to be passed along regardless
  "context": {  
        "connections": ["list", "of", "pre-injected", "connections"],
        "...",
    }
}
```

#### Dag Parsing Changes
* Strong identity for the source file being parsed
* The same Task SDK during
    * dag parsing
    * task execution
* Callback details TBD
    * run in the parsing process and will need to be "passed down" to it

#### Connection/Variable security models
* a.k.a. push/inject secrets into tasks or allow tasks to request secrets.
* Details TBD

### Which users are affected by the change?
* Operators that needed direct DB access need re-writing

## Distro proposal based on the Task Execution Interface
這是在 [Airflow dev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/gm2rj7s4vsnyt95bxbh1pjkht49zvb3t) 跟 [AIP-72] 高度相關的提案
所以我就一起讀了

* [link to the google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isjpMKYdgdYpEGQDtN2hKrJ-oq8qFWU9kqootRUHiX8/edit)

### Task Context: Incoming to Tasks
* Information obtained from the API server for task execution
    * Connections
    * Secrets
    * XCom
    * Variables
    * Log output location reference
    * Composite TaskRunID

### Task Status and Output: Outgoing from Tasks
* information sent to the API server
    * Tasks Completion status
    * XCom *(optional)*
    * Variables (write) *(optional)*
    * Log information *(optional)*
    * Heartbeat
        * The scheduler knows that this task is still running

### User scenarios
> Worth reading, but I'm going to skip it in my digest

### Distro proposal
1. Server Distribution (based on Python)
    * MetaDB handling
    * Scheduler / Executor
    * API server
    * Web server
    * DAG File processor
    * Executor providers (Celery / k8s / Edge)
    * Logging providers (*maybe❓*)
    * Server providers (Secrets backend, AuthMgr backend, etc.) (*as needed*)
2. Python Task SDK (python distribution)
    * TEI serialization / deserialization
    * HTTP / REST client and token authentication capabilities
    * Default operators
    * Logging write provider (*maybe❓*)
    * Providers (hooks / operators / sensors) (*as needed*)
3. Consolidated Distribution (1 + 2)
4. Golang Task SDK (Go distribution)
    * similar to 2 but in Go
