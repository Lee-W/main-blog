The last time I came to [PyCon US]({filename}/posts/tech/2019/03-how-was-pycon-us-2019.md). I had quite a good time during the development sprint and had a few of my PRs merged. (even though the one to CPython was later closed ü•≤) So yep, I think this might be a good idea to host a [development sprint](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/dev-sprints/) for [commitizen-tools](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/). üëÄ

Disclaimer: the doll has absolutely nothing to do with Python and commitizen-tools. It's just cute, and it might make it easier for people to find me üòÜ

It turns out that no one is interested in such a small project. ü•≤ I met someone who said he wanted to take a look, but he left after lunch. I feel like I've already gotten used to it, or maybe I just should. Or I should just lead [airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow/) next time ü•≤

Nonetheless, this sprint was quite intensive and productive for commitizen-tools. With [@marcosdotme](https://github.com/marcosdotme) (who didn't even attend PyCon US) and I, we achieved the following results.

I also want to thank Yucheng for attempting to address [UnicodeDecodeError when running cz bump #1110](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/issues/1110)

The great thing is that I finally managed to triage **all** issues with the `issue-status: needs-triage` label! but... found out we still need to check issues filed before [the labeling system](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/contributing/#use-of-github-labels) was introduced.

Among all the PRs I worked on yesterday,  [fix: add description for subcommands #1120](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/pull/1120) was quite interesting. I didn't know that `argparse` changed the prompt of optional arguments from `Optional Arguments` to `options` since Python 3.10.

During the sprint, I shared commitizen-tools with Takanory„Åï„Çì. Later, he introduced me to [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier), a similar tool that I plan to explore further. We also had a great chat about Star Wars. üåü I was excited to share that I went to [Rise of the Resistance](https://travlog.wei-lee.me/posts/travel/2019/12/rise-of-the-resistance/) on the very first day it opened. üöÄ

After the sprint, a couple of APAC folks went to this church restaurant. It was quite a pleasant dinner. Always love to hangout with Pythonistas üòÑ
