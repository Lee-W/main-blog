This is an excerpt of Zapier's book [The Ultimate Guide to Remote Work](https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/).
I had a good time chatting with Zapier in PyCon US and then found this book on their website.
Since I currently work remotely, I thrive on making myself a better remote worker.
Hope this excerpt would help if you're working remotely or considering it.

* Ability to prioritize
* Proficient writing
* Trustworthy
* People with Local support system

## Chapter 5: How to Build Strong Relationships in a Remote Team

* Performance Review combines the following 3 aspects
    * Manager's own opinions
    * Thoughts from co-workers
    * A self-evaluation from the actual employee

* If you're setting up phone or video calls to meet your new teammates, try setting a time limit of 15 minutes.
    * Putting aside our own desires to contribute to the conversation and instead asking short, open questions like how, when, and why.

* Replying on Text the Right Way
    1. Stay Up to Date
    2. Remember Hanlon's Razor: We should always assume ignorance before malice

* Asserting Yourself When Needed
    * set up rules ahead of time
        * e.g., set up your focus time and ask others not to message you at this time
    * Find a way to share the context of your situation with your teammates.
        * Keep in mind all the information you have about how you feel and your current needs that your teammates don't have. They need all the information you can give them to work with you in the best way they can.

## Chapter 10: How to Work Faster in a Remote Team

* "If employees don't have freedom and independence to make decisions, remote work will be less effective."

* How to deal with vast numbers of emails?
    * Company and department updates, project specs, design mock-ups, and individual "Friday Update" reports moved from email to our private internal blog
    * Team and department feedback, along with questions and discussions, moved to Slack, which replaced one-on-one email threads with its private messaging feature, too.

* Whether it's working in your own home or a nearby coffee shop, there's another aspect that pushes remote employees to work faster: **You're responsible for your productivity**.

* Completely unplug from the communication tools. Do this, and then put 100% focus on writing in a distraction-free environment.

## Chapter 11: How to Find Your Optimal Work Environment and Boost Productivity

* If you have different types of work, grouping similar tasks into time "chunks" can make you more productive than switching between different types of work.
    * Small, simple tasks can be saved for the periods when you're low in energy, or in-between meetings.
    * Work on the big, intense projects first, and work on smaller tasks that don't have deadlines as you go through the day.

## Chapter 12: How to Work in Different Timezones

* Manage projects in an asynchronous way
    * Break things up into chunks that can be worked on individually
    * Find time to sync back up on what's been done, and make sure each person can self-direct their work
* Work in an asynchronous way
    * Check in with your team before you start your workday and make sure you're on the same page as everyone else.
    * To work effectively with a time shift, you'll also need to work in public. In other words, communicate, and make sure everyone knows what you're working on.
    * Write what you've done that day, share where you're hung up on a project, and ping others with ideas.

## Chapter 13: How to Avoid Burnout in a Remote Team

1. Establish and Maintain a Routine
2. Set and Stick to Priorities
    * 'Have I done the most important work I could do today?'
        * when I can say yes to that, then I can log off, recharge, and invest in the other areas of my life.
3. Create and Keep Boundaries
    * Find your rhythm and protect it to avoid burnout.
        * For me, that rhythm means taking time to reflect and celebrate progress when planning, and setting boundaries like working outside of my apartment at a co-working space or scheduling deliberate non-work time into my week.
4. Take Short and Long Breaks
    * Take a three-day weekend every now and then.
    * Make sure to get away from everything for a week or two each year.
5. Make Time for Human Interaction
    * Prioritize your social activities, because they are a form of self-care.

* Recruit - 4 essential traits
    1. You're tech-savvy
    2. You're an efficient communicator
    3. You're independent and trustworthy
    4. You've mastered time management
