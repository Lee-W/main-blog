## Work Experience
**[Feb 2023 - Present] Software Engineer, [astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/)**
* apache-airflow
    * Fixed a circular import error prior to releasing new airflow providers ([#31379](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31379))
    * Fixed an Amazon provider bug due to new airflow providers release ([#31482](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31482))
    * Integrated the AsyncSensors logic into their Sensor counterpart and lessen the maintenance burden ([#30014](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30014), [#30227](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30227),[#30231](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30231),[#30235](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30235), [#30250](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30250))
* [astronomer-providers](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers)
    * Reduced async operator overhead by adding checks before sending the task to triggerer ([issue 1102](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/issues/1102))
    * Automated the deployment of integration tests and testing against the release of the airflow provider ([#987](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/pull/987), [#1107](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/pull/1107), [#1139](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/pull/1139), [#1110](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/pull/1110))

**[Apr 2017 - Feb 2023] Machine Leraning Engineer, [Rakuten USA](https://www.rakuten.com/)**

* Productionize machine learning projects
    * Implemented SQS and gRPC services for grouping emails with similar structures and extracting user-sensitive data to increase the amount of training data without violating customer privacy regulations.
  *  Designed and Implemented a two-stage labeling system that automatically communicates between Amazon Mechanical Turk and in-house experts to generate high-quality labeled data and enhance merchandise taxonomy to increase customer conversion rate.
  * Migrated and automated the deployment process of AWS Lambda procedures that process customer lifetime value, reducing the effort of maintenance and deployment.
* Build and maintain data pipelines on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
    * Implemented a pipeline that processes data larger than 10 GB to infer personalized preferences to help increase customer satisfaction.
    * Migrated legacy 1.x Airflow server on AWS EC2 to 2.0.2 Airflow on AWS MWAA, saving developers' effort on dealing with legacy dependencies issues, and created a development airflow environment for doing experiments without affecting the production pipeline.
    * Refactored data writing mechanism and reduced the data write time and AWS S3 cost.
    * Built alerts and dashboards to monitor pipelines metrics to minimize the effort of troubleshooting using DataDog, Prometheus, and Kibana.
* Standardize and maintain software engineering practices
    * Created and maintain the project templates, with automatic code quality check, testing, containerization, project versioning, releasing, and deployment, and a standard workflow for existing projects to update tools, which reduced project creation time, the communication overhead during code review and provided an easy way for developers to introduce new standards.
    * Implemented a life-cycle configuration management tool and a workflow for creating Amazon Sagemaker notebook instances which saves data scientists' time on handling engineering problems.
    * Improved container build time and reduced execution time by 70\% for Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.
    * Maintain core package that's used among most existing projects
* Optimized SQL in a data pipeline and reduced the execution time from infeasible to within half a day.
* Cooperate with overseas teams in US, Ukraine, and India

**[Jan 2019 - March 2019] Project Manager, [DLT Lab](https://dlt.csie.ncku.edu.tw)**
