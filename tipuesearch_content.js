I had a good time chatting with Zapier in PyCon US and then found this book on their website. Since I currently work remotely, I thrive on making myself a better remote worker. Hope this excerpt would help if you're working remotely or considering it. Chapter 1: How to Run a Remote Team Important ingredients to remote work Team Tools Process Team Hire Doers → default to action Hire people you can trust Trust the people you hire Hire people who can write Communication is one of the most important parts of a remote team. Hire people who are ok without a social workplace It'll be important to try to create some social aspects with a remote team. But the truth is that remote workplaces are usually less social than co-located ones. Tools Slack → If you're in Slack then you're at work Trello Trick to avoid getting card overload Each card needs to have Detailed description of the feature Why it's important the results of a successful implementation of it should look like GitHub 1Password Google Docs & Quip Zoom HelloSign Process Everyone does support Culture of shipping Weekly Hangouts Air Buddies Weekly One-on-Ones A culture of accountability People often ask \"how do you know if employees are actually working?\" → Friday updates Building culture in person Automate anything that can be automated Chapter 3: How to Hire a Remote Team Propensity towards action Ability to prioritize Proficient writing Trustworthy People with Local support system Chapter 5: How to Build Strong Relationships in a Remote Team Performance Review combines the following 3 aspects Manager's own opinions Thoughts from co-workers A self-evaluation from the actual employee If you're setting up phone or video calls to meet your new teammates, try setting a time limit of 15 minutes. Putting aside our own desires to contribute to the conversation and instead asking short, open questions like how, when, and why. Replying on Text the Right Way Stay Up to Date Remember Hanlon's Razor: We should always assume ignorance before malice Asserting Yourself When Needed set up rules ahead of time e.g., set up your focus time and ask others not to message you at this time Find a way to share the context of your situation with your teammates. Keep in mind all the information you have about how you feel and your current needs that your teammates don't have. They need all the information you can give them to work with you in the best way they can. Chapter 10: How to Work Faster in a Remote Team \"If employees don't have freedom and independence to make decisions, remote work will be less effective.\" How to deal with vast numbers of emails? Company and department updates, project specs, design mock-ups, and individual \"Friday Update\" reports moved from email to our private internal blog Team and department feedback, along with questions and discussions, moved to Slack, which replaced one-on-one email threads with its private messaging feature, too. Whether it's working in your own home or a nearby coffee shop, there's another aspect that pushes remote employees to work faster: You're responsible for your productivity . Completely unplug from the communication tools. Do this, and then put 100% focus on writing in a distraction-free environment. Chapter 11: How to Find Your Optimal Work Environment and Boost Productivity If you have different types of work, grouping similar tasks into time \"chunks\" can make you more productive than switching between different types of work. Small, simple tasks can be saved for the periods when you're low in energy, or in-between meetings. Work on the big, intense projects first, and work on smaller tasks that don't have deadlines as you go through the day. Chapter 12: How to Work in Different Timezones Manage projects in an asynchronous way Break things up into chunks that can be worked on individually Find time to sync back up on what's been done, and make sure each person can self-direct their work Work in an asynchronous way Check in with your team before you start your workday and make sure you're on the same page as everyone else. To work effectively with a time shift, you'll also need to work in public. In other words, communicate, and make sure everyone knows what you're working on. Write what you've done that day, share where you're hung up on a project, and ping others with ideas. Chapter 13: How to Avoid Burnout in a Remote Team Establish and Maintain a Routine Set and Stick to Priorities 'Have I done the most important work I could do today?' when I can say yes to that, then I can log off, recharge, and invest in the other areas of my life. Create and Keep Boundaries Find your rhythm and protect it to avoid burnout. For me, that rhythm means taking time to reflect and celebrate progress when planning, and setting boundaries like working outside of my apartment at a co-working space or scheduling deliberate non-work time into my week. Take Short and Long Breaks Take a three-day weekend every now and then. Make sure to get away from everything for a week or two each year. Make Time for Human Interaction Prioritize your social activities, because they are a form of self-care. Recruit - 4 essential traits You're tech-savvy You're an efficient communicator You're independent and trustworthy You've mastered time management Where to Find Remote Jobs FlexJobs is a job board that showcases not just telecommuting openings, but also job postings for other types of flexible arrangements, such as freelance or part-time work. Price: $14.95/month to $49.95/year Jobspresso allows you to search for jobs in specific categories, such as marketing, copywriting, project management, and support. All of the jobs listed are curated for remote workers. Remote.co is passionate about remote work and partners with startups that feel the same way. We Work Remotely is sponsored by Basecamp and their book Remote, which delves into all things related to working remotely. The job board is updated daily, and you can subscribe to the site's RSS feed to get informed of new job postings. Working Nomads provides a curated list of remote jobs for individuals who want to travel while they work. How to Apply and Interview for a Remote Work Job Prepare for the video interview If you're positive, curious, and articulate in the video chat as well as other parts of the application process, hiring managers will be more confident about you. Try out the video app before the interview. Find a quiet space where you can focus on your interview and won't be distracted. Dress professionally and stay engaged during the interview. Explain why you want the exact position. Just wanting to work at a remote company is usually not enough for specialized roles. You might be asked about or want to mention things like Successful solo projects you've started or team projects you've led. Your reasons for wanting to work remotely. What makes you fit for working on a remote team? (independence and trustworthiness) Previous writing experience and other communication skills How do you choose the communication tool for different situations? (communication skills) Your daily routine and methods to stay focused. What are your optimal work hours? What's your workspace like? How do you prioritize tasks? How do you balance work and personal life? (time management skills) Questions you should ask to make sure the company is really serious about remote work How many people do you have working remotely full-time? Is occasional travel needed to meet with co-workers? How does the remote team usually communicate? What would my typical schedule and day look like? How often would I be in touch with my manager? If you're applying for an employer in another country, before accepting a position it's a good idea to find out: How will taxes be taken care of from my paycheck? Will I need to buy my own health plan? Would I need to get a work permit when visiting the employer?

Ace Your Technical Interview Using Python Migrating Pinterest from Python2 to Python3 Scraping a Million Pokemon Battles: Distributed Systems By Example Practical decorators Break the Cycle: Three excellent Python tools to automate repetitive tasks Open Space 畢竟 talk 都會錄影，而且很快就上傳了（大概結束後兩天就會上傳） 所以後來我就越來越常去 Open Space 而且相較之下 Open Space 會比較有跟人互動的機會 除了一些比較技術性的討論外 也會有不少娛樂性的 Open Space（通常在晚上） 像這個就是揪團要一起看 Game of Throne XD 大部分討論性質的 Open Space 會像這樣圍成一圈 這是我去參加 Vim 討論會的照片 當天就有人分享了討論的筆記 ( Vim BoF @PyCon2019 ) 我還有參加到一場幫忙做履歷健檢的跟討論 Tech Interview Job Fair / Poster Job Fair 主要就是跟各個公司聊天，看看他們的工作性質跟開了什麼缺 有聽到幾間 remote 的公司還蠻有趣的 不過其實也不用等到 Job Fair 才問 Job Fair 的公司反而比較少，不過應該就是專注在有開缺的公司 前幾天的攤位反而更有機會聊聊 Poster 也是一個能跟人互動蠻好的機會 不過那些比較有趣的，通常旁邊都會圍著一群人 XD Hypothesis 好像整個 session 人都沒少過 （話說 Hypothesis 還真的從 talk, tutorial, sprint 到 poster 每個場合都出現了） Development Sprint 自從上次在 PyCon TW 參加了 PyBee 的 Sprint ，就覺得這樣一群人協作開源專案很有趣 所以這也是我這次 PyCon 幾乎最期待的活動 在 Development Sprint ，開源專案的作者會帶自己的專案找大家一起來協作 沒有帶專案來的人就可以看自己對哪個有興趣加入貢獻 參加 Development Sprint 是貢獻開源專案還蠻好的入門方式 畢竟原作者跟 core contributor 就在旁邊 有遇到什麼問題想問馬上就可以問 我這次參加了 pallets , cpython , pybee , OpenEdx 的 Sprint 每一個專案，我在最後都有提交至少一個小 PR 這次最有成就感的大概就是成功提交了一個 flask 跟 cpython 的 PR （雖然 cpython 的其實還在 review 中） 這幾個專案之中，我覺得 pybee , OpenEdx 算是最新手友善的 Sprint 的這幾天還蠻常看到 Guido 在走廊走來走去 也蠻多人去找他搭話跟拍照的 不過害羞的我就有點不敢過去了 QQ 給自己下次去的建議 多跟人交流、多跟人交流、多跟人交流 這是我感受到跟在台灣參加研討會最不一樣的地方 （也可能是我在台灣的研討會都在舒適圈中...） 只要你願意，在會場中幾乎每個人都很樂於跟你交流 可能你只是站在一個桌子上吃早餐，就會有人過來跟你聊聊 這個體驗真的蠻有趣的 練好英文口說 原本覺得自己英文程度雖然稱不上好，但應該也沒到太差吧 至少在旅行上是沒遇過什麼問題 但這種程度跟要跟人討論或聊天還是差太多了 當然要說點話是沒什麼問題，但要流暢表達自己就還是蠻困難的 一對一的聊天還算勉強有辦法 到了團體討論就真的很吃力 光在聽力上要跟上大家在討論的就有點辛苦 就更不用說要加入討論了 剛到 PyCon 的前幾天對於這件事還真的蠻挫折的 準備好一段短的招呼語跟自我介紹 一開始有人來找我聊天，還是會有些緊張，不知道要說什麼 畢竟在台灣真的也沒什麼這樣練習英文口說的機會 後來多跟幾個人聊過後 自然而然就形成了一套跟人開頭的招呼語跟自我介紹 之後話題就能比較順利地一直接下去 留點緩衝時間給調時差 這次到美國的隔天就已經要開始 PyCon 了 一到了傍晚就會開始想睡 所以前幾天的 After Party 我參加一下就走了 後來也沒去參加 Facebook 一來是我也有點不知道怎麼在這種場合應對 二來是真的太累了... 保留體力 - 不用每個活動都參與到 剛來的時候會覺得，都花了這麼多錢特地跑來，一定要把握時間每 就會勉強自己盡可能每個時段都要塞滿 但 PyCon 的 talk, open space and etc. 實在太多了 真的要塞滿，體力就有點負荷不來，後來就都是邊睡邊聽...... 中間可以留一些時間在 Quiet Room 稍微休息 與其多衝一些場數，不如專注地把幾場真正想聽的專心聽完 多去 Open Space 相較於 talk ， Open Space 除了沒有錄影可以補帶以外 也是一個跟人們可以更有互動的機會 有時候說不定也能聽到一些不能在 talk 說的事（笑 而且我覺得在這應該是蠻有機會交到一些朋友的場合 （雖然我後來認識的大多是在走廊上或吃飯遇到的 XD） 事前對有興趣的 talk 準備好想問的問題 雖然說看現場的感受跟看影片還是不一樣 但既然都去聽了，如果能跟講者討論自己遇到的問題，應該會更有收穫 將當下的熱情紀錄下來，並列出 action items 參加的當下的感受還蠻強烈的，但回來台灣好一段時間後 當初的熱情跟想法，就會慢慢被生活給磨光 所以立刻把明確的 action items 記錄下來，也許會讓這些事情成真的機會高一點 寫下這篇文章，某種程度上也是想記錄下這次參加的感受呢 食物 （20190703 update） 既然有人問了，就來補充一下吧 XD 首先是從 Tutorial 開始到 Sprint 結束的九天 每天都有星巴克可以喝 雖然到 Sprint 的時候好像已經把經費花光 臨時又有廠商在贊助才能撐到結束 議程以外那幾天大多是自助式 大概都是這樣的沙拉 議程那幾天就有點像是餐盒 有豬、牛、素、水果幾種可以選 像這個就是牛排，吃起來就還不錯 這個也是牛排 但吃起來很可怕...... 上面那個餅皮我真的努力要吃過了，但我失敗了＠＠ 這是我待在美國這一個月最難吃的食物...... 恩，大概就只有這樣xD 雜談 一開始對於要不要飛一趟去美國還蠻猶豫的 畢竟 PyCon 的 talk 網路上都看得到，花這一大筆錢真的值得嗎？ 而且自己一個跑到一個人生地不熟的地方也是挺可怕的 其實這些問題我到最後也沒給自己一個好的答覆 反正就覺得現在如果不衝動地做這件事，也許就不會有下次了 就毅然決然的買了機票跟門票 逼得自己沒有退路，一定得要去 以結論來說，我覺得非常值得 而且如果有可能，我明年還是會想去 PyCon 2020 in Pittsburgh 在 PyCon 體驗到一些我在台灣比較不會接觸到的事 平常也許可以看看文章，聽別人說說這些故事 但這跟實際現場的體會真的太不一樣了 最大的感受是「那些原先覺得做不到的事，似乎變得不再那麼遙遠」 當然我在美國其實待了一個多月，也是去了不少地方 說不定哪天有空也會寫篇遊記 這篇快速整理了一下我現在想到的，也許之後還會再補點內容","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2019/06/how-was-pycon-us","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2019/06/how-was-pycon-us"},{"title":"[Book] OKR

(我只把我認為容易被忽略或特別重要的幾點留下來) Whitespace 過長的 expressions 要接續到其他文字行時，除了原本的縮排層次，應再加上額外的 四個空格 來縮排 Naming protected instance attributes → _leading_underscore private instance attributes → __double_leading_underscore Class, exceptions → CapitalizedWord model-level constant → ALL_CAPS Statements 使用行內否定 (inline negation, e.g., if a is not b )，而非否定正向的運算式 (negation of positive expressions, e.g., if not a is b ) 別用查驗長度的方式 ( if len(somelist) == 0 ) 來檢查空值。使用 if not somelist 避免單行 if , for , while , except ，將它們分多行描述以清楚表達 import module 永遠用絕對名稱 e.g., 用 from bar import foo 而不是 import foo import 順序 standard library modules third-party modules your own modules 用 pylint 來檢查風格 作法04： 撰寫輔助函式而非複雜的運算式 將複雜的運算式移到輔助函式 (helper function) 內，特別是在你需要重複用到同樣的邏輯的時候 與其在運算式中使用 or 或 and ，不如使用 if/else 讓程式碼更易讀 my_values = { 'red' : [ '5' ], green : [ '' ] } # or, and red = int ( my_values . get ( 'red' , [ '' ])[ 0 ] or 0 ) # if/else red = int ( red [ 0 ]) if red [ 0 ] else 0 # even better if/else if red [ 0 ]: red = red [ 0 ] else : red = 0 # helper function def get_first_int ( values , key , default = 0 ): found = values . get ( key , [ '' ]) if found [ 0 ]: found = int ( found [ 0 ]) else : found = default return found red = get_first_int ( my_values , 'red' ) 作法05: 知道如何切割序列 省略 zero index, 最後的索引來降低視覺雜訊 用 a[:5] , a[5:] 而不是 a[0:5] , a[5:len(a)] copy value v.s. copy reference # copy value b = a [:] assert b == a assert b is not a # copy reference b = a assert b is a 作法07: 使用 list comprehension 而非 map 和 filter 避免用 map , filter ，因為使用他們時需要建立一個 lambda ，這是種視覺雜訊 a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] # list comprehension squares = [ x ** 2 for x in a ] # map squares = map ( lambda x : x ** 2 , a ) 作法09: 考慮使用 generator 取代大型 list comprehension 對於大型輸入來說 list comprehension 可能耗用相當大量的記憶體 作法11: 使用 zip 來平行處理 iterables a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] b = [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' ] # without zip for i , x in enumerate ( a ): print ( x , b [ i ]) # with zip for x , y in zip ( a , b ): print ( x , y ) 如果提供了不同長度的 iterables ， zip 會 truncate 掉較長的 input 作法12: 避免在 for 或 while 後面使用 else 區塊 # avoid for i in range ( 3 ): ... else : ... 作法13: 善用 try/except/else/finally 中的每個區塊 finally 即使例外發生，但也想要在例外發生時執行清理用的 cleanup code else 如果 try 沒有丟出例外， else 區塊就會執行 用來最小化 try 區塊的程式碼量 → 讓 try 區塊只出現會丟出例外的程式碼 第二章： 函式 作法14: 優先選用例外處理而非回傳 None 回傳 None 帶有特殊意義的函式容易出錯，因為 None 與其他的值 (e.g., 0 , [] , '' )，在做條件運算式運算的結果都是 False 作法20: 使用 None 與 Docstrings 來指定 mutable default arguments default arguments 只會被 evaluate 一次：模組載入時、函式定義時。對於動態值 (e.g., {} , [] ) 來說，這可能導致奇怪的行為 from datetime import datetime def func ( default = datetime . now ()): print ( default ) # The two results would be the same but should be different func () func () Fix from datetime import datetime def func ( default = None ): \"\"\"Demonstration Args: default: current datetime \"\"\" if not default : default = datetime . now () print ( default ) 作法19: 以 keyword argument 提供選擇性的行為 (Related to 作法21) # original def flow_rate ( weight_diff , time_diff , period ): return ( weight_diff / time_diff ) * period # with default argument def flow_rate ( weight_diff , time_diff , period = 1 ): return ( weight_diff / time_diff ) * period 不像「作法21」全面採取 keyword argement的原因是為了達到 backwards compatibility 作法21: 強制使用僅限 keyword argument 來讓程式碼更清楚易懂 使用 keyword-only arguments 來強制要求呼叫者提供 keyword argument 以避免混淆，特別是在接收多個 Boolean flag 的函式中 # * indicates the end of positional arguments def safe_division ( number , divisor , * , ignore_overflow = False ): ... 第三章： 類別與繼承 作法22: 優先選用輔助 class 而非使用 dictionary 或 tuple 來管理紀錄 如果還不需要用到較有彈性的完整 class，請使用 namedtuple 來製作輕量化、不可變的資料容器 namedtuple 不能指定預設引數值，如果資料有許多 optional properties，則還是適合用 class 作法25: 使用 super 來初始化父類別 class Implicit ( BaseClass ): def __init__ ( self , value ): super () . __init__ ( value * 2 ) 作法27: 優先選用公開屬性而非私有屬性 為什麼私有屬性的語法不強制施行嚴格的可見性限制呢？ We are all consenting adults here. 選擇私有屬性，只會讓子類別的 overrides 或 extensions 動作變得更麻煩更容易出錯 一般來說最好選擇使用 protected attributes 唯一得認真考慮使用 private attributes 的時機，是擔心子類別會有名稱衝突的時候 第四章： 元類別與屬性 作法33, 34, 35 Metaclass 的應用 驗證 subclass 是否有被正確定義 註冊 class 的存在 在一個 class 被實際使用前，修改其特性 第五章： 共時與平行處理 共時 (concurrency): 作業系統會在單一處理器快速切換多個執行程式 平行處理 (parallelism): 真正在同一時間執行許多工作的處理方式 作法38: 使用 Lock 來避免執行緒中的 data race class Count : def __init__ ( self ): self . count = 0 def increment ( self , offset ): self . count += offset 如果用 thread 去跑 increment 會造成 data race 原因是 counter . count += offset 實際上執行了三個 operation 等效於以下的程式碼 value = getattr ( counter , 'count' ) result = value + offset setattr ( counter , 'count' , result ) 這時候必須在 increment 加上 Lock 避免 data race class LockingCounter : def __init__ ( self ): self . lock = Lock () def increment ( self , offset ): with self . lock : self . count += offset 作法39: 使用 Queue 來協調執行緒之間的工作 from queue import Queue queue = Queue () def consumer (): print ( 'consumer waiting' ) queue . get () print ( 'consumer done' ) thread = Thread ( target = consumer ) thread . start () print ( 'Producer putting' ) queue . put ( object ()) thread . join () print ( 'Producer done' ) 作法41: 考慮使用 concurrent.futures 來達成真正的平行處理 from concurrent.futures import multiprocessing 藉由執行額外的直譯器作為 child processes。因為這些 child processes 跟主直譯器是分開的，所以它們的 GIL 也是分開的 使用 multiprocessing 的成本很高 因為 main process 和 child processes 的溝通需要透過 serialization 和 deserialization multiprocessing 適合 isolated: 不必與程式其他部分共用狀態的 function high-leverage: 在 main process 和 child processes 只需要轉移少量的資料，就能進行大量計算的狀況 multiprocessing 最好只用到 concurrent.futures 的 built-in module 和 ProcessPoolExecutor class 其他部分過於複雜，建議避免 第六章： 內建模組 作法34: 考慮使用 contextlib 與 with statement 來建立可重用的 try/finally 行為 from contextlib import contextmanager @contextmanager def log_level ( level , name ): logger = logging . getLogger ( name ) old_level = logger . getEffectiveLevel () logger . setLevel ( level ) try : yield logger finally : logger . setLevel ( old ) with log_level ( logging . DEBUG , 'mylog' ) as logger : logger . debug ( 'This is my message!' ) logging . debut ( 'This will not print' ) yield 前是 contextmanager 的 __enter__ 會執行的部分，之後則是 __exit__ 作法45: 本地時鐘使用 datetime 而非 time 搭配 pytz module 來使用 datetime built-in module 在不同時區的時間之間作轉換 處理過程中，永遠用 UTC 來記錄，呈現給使用者前才轉換 第七章： 協作 作法49: 為每個 function, class, module 撰寫 Docstrings General Docstring Guide 用3個 double quotes ( \"\"\" ) 開頭 第一行應該是單一句子，來描寫用途 接下來的文字含有使用者應該知道的作業細節 class 將重要的 public attribute 和 method 在 class level 的 docstring 寫出 public function / method 寫上 function 的特殊行為, argument 和 return value 如果沒有 argument, return value，單句描述應該就夠了 如果不會回傳任何東西，就不要提到 return value，而不是寫 \"return None\" 如果有用到數目不定的 argument , keyword-argument，應該用 *args , **kwargs 來描述 如果有 default argument 都應該被提及 如果是一個 generator，應該描述 iterate 時會 yield 什麼 如果是 coroutine，應該描述 會產生什麼 預期從 yield 收到什麼 什麼時候會停止 作法50: 使用 package 來組織 module 並提供穩定的 API Python 可以透過 module 或 package 的 __all__ 特殊屬性來限制要暴露給 API 使用者的「表面積」 如此即使重構也不會影響到使用者 這在提供明確、穩定、給外部使用的 API 是個很好的做法 如果只是在建置自己 module 間使用的 API 則是應該避免的做法 盡可能使用 from x import y ，而不是 import * import * 可能造成變數名稱複寫，而且不容易被 debug 作法51: 定義一個 root exception 來隔離呼叫者與 API 為什麼要自定義一個 root exception? 讓使用者知道他們以錯誤的用法使用了你的 API 幫助你找出 API 中的 bug → 只要不是提出這些自定義的例外，就很可能是 bug 的所在 作法52: 知道如何打破循環依存性 最好的做法是重構程式碼 但有時候清楚的劃分相當困難，或 cost 太高了，因此還是需要知道如何打破循環依存性 解法一： 重新安排匯入順序 這是一個比較不好的做法，違反了 PEP 8，且容易讓程式碼稍微的修改就造成問題 解法二： import, configure and execute 讓 module 只作定義 function, class 和 constant，不做實際執行 每個 module 提供一個 configure 函式，讓所有 module 都完成匯入後才呼叫 許多狀況下都能運作良好，並且讓 dependency injection 變得可能 缺點 很難重新組織程式碼架構 因為物件的定義和 configuration 在不同的地方，造成程式碼更難閱讀 解法三： 動態匯入 通常是最簡單的解法 在 function/method 中才使用 import 但一般來說來是最好避免， import 的 cost 並沒有小到可以被忽略 第八章： 推出產品 作法57: 考慮使用 pdb 來進行互動式除錯 在程式碼加入以下這行，就能讓程式執行到這一步時停下，開啟互動式的 python shell python import pdf; pdf.set_trace() 檢視執行中的程式 bt : 印出目前 call stack 的 traceback up : 上移 call stack down : 下移 call stack 恢復程式的執行 step : 執行程式，直到下一行 next : 執行程式，直到遇到目前函式的下一行 return : 執行程式，直到目前函式回傳 continue : 執行程式，直到下一個 breakpoint 或 set_trace 再被呼叫 作法58: 最佳化之前先進行效能評估 使用 cProfile module 而非 profile module 因為對程式效能的影響較小 from cProfile import Profile from pstats import Stats # some program to test import test profiler = Profile () profiler . runcall ( test ) stats = Stats ( profiler ) stats . strip_dirs () stats . sort_stats ( 'cumulative' ) stats . print_stats () 作法59: 使用 tracemalloc 來了解記憶體用量或是否有洩漏 Python 的預設實作 CPython 中，記憶體管理的方式是使用 reference counting Python 3.4 以後可以使用 tracemalloc import tracemalloc tracemalloc . start ( 10 ) time1 = tracemalloc . take_snapshot () # some code that waste memory time2 = tracemallo . take_snapshot () stats = time2 . compare_to ( time1 , 'lineno' ) for stat in stats : print ( stat )","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2019/01/effective-python","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2019/01/effective-python"},{"title":"[Book] 電腦玩物站長的筆記思考術","text":"去年剛看完這本書的時候，實在覺得跟想像的很不一樣 直到現在終於有空好好的再翻過一遍，做一些紀錄了 原本以為會是很明確的 xxx筆記法...如何在生活中實用之類的 不過這本書主要在講的「如何用記錄下來的東西帶起自己的行動」 至於怎麼做筆記（e.g., 什麼格式），就不是它的重點了 雖然跟原先期待的不一樣，但我反而蠻喜歡這樣的內容 尤其我自己也有一套反省、紀錄生活的方式 翻著它就感嘆「原來還能這麼做啊」xD 這本書大概不會是那種即刻有效的考試筆記術之類的 它所提的想法和技巧，都是需要時間慢慢融入自己的生活當中 但相信這些思考都會對如何管理自己的人生很有幫助的 一、筆記技巧 記錄過去是為了改變未來，試著思考這些問題 為什麼會這樣？ 我是怎麼想的？ 我想要變成怎樣？ 筆記有用與否的重點在於 「付諸行動」 筆記時，就要思考筆記怎麼使用 我可能怎麼利用它 我想利用它來達到什麼目的 筆記的三層思考空間 行動層 → 我的行動 我要採取什麼行動來改變 構思層 → 我的想法 (最精華的筆記內容) 當下的想法 列舉大綱 收集到的資料重點 封存層 → 我的紀錄 (雜亂但可能具有參考價值的思考過程和零散資料) 參考資料 DRAW 計畫筆記法 Destination 確認目標： 我想要達成的目標，達成是什麼樣的具體景象？ Roadmap 畫出路線圖 Action 列出行動步驟 Warnings 評估風險 建立觀點的筆記練習 「寫作輸出」可以加速學習與成長、訓練獨立思考 練習條列重點 抓出看到或想到的重點 用關鍵字句濃縮重點 條列重點，並思考重點的排序 跳開原文，嘗試用自己的話說明重點 找出原文沒提到的重點 練習窮舉範疇 從一個事件，思考背後的現象 窮盡現象背後所有的面相 幫這個現象做分類定義 練習分析追問 「為什麼...」, 「因為...」 對習以為常的結論，重新練習追問為什麼？ 練習翻轉想法 「如果... 會怎樣」, 「還有可能...」, 「為什麼不？」 不同的前提會導出不同的結論 → 練習以不同角度觀看同一件事 精煉過去的元經驗筆記 不只是寫下經驗了什麼，而是拆解出經驗背後的結構、規則 → 重複利用、方便組合的元經驗 → 累積自己的 SOP 清單 二、筆記整理 資料本身是死的，把它收納整理好，他更加無法行動 除非不是整理資料，而是納入真正行動的工作流程中 如果稍後閱讀違背了「好好讀完一篇文章」的本意，而變成「收集現在沒時間讀的文章」的工具，那長久下來就會變成一個問題「為什麼我總在沒時間讀的時候看文章？然後不斷收集沒時間讀的文章？」 整理是要處理，而不是收集用不到的東西 學習經驗背後的邏輯、方法，而非照著經驗的結果做 對於新工具先體驗，不需要搞懂 先試試看 透過多試錯理解工具或方法背後設計的意義 試錯後回頭看文章和說明更能理解上面的意思 → 體驗後，才能加快學習與研究 嘗試後開口問，才有辦法問出有價值的問題 三、時間筆記 時間管理不是完成所有事情，而是選擇重要的事情完成 處理壓力 承認有壓力，看到自己的困境 認知到壓力是情緒，不是現實 清空大腦的筆記法 讓煩惱「儲存在外部清單」，也讓期待可以被「客觀看見」 把雜事列成清單 整理清單，給雜事不同的權重與判斷 把焦慮和壓力，置換成下一步行動 克服拖延 列待辦清單時，之所以做不到，常常是因為我們寫下了「困難到我不想去行動」的任務 什麼時候不會有拖延?

Clean Code 只做好一件事 Clean Code 是可以被原作者以外的開發者閱讀與增強的 Beck's rules for simple code 能通過所有測試 沒有重複的程式碼 充份表達系統設計的構思 具有最少的 entities (e.g. class, methods, functions, and etc.) 每一次修改程式碼之後，都得讓程式碼變得比修改之前再更乾淨 童子軍原則: 每次你到過的營地，離開後要比之前更乾淨 第2章：有意義的命名 Variables, methods, classes 要能解釋他們為什麼在這、做什麼用和怎麼使用它 變數名稱要唸得出來 (e.g., genYMDHMS ) 較小的名稱如果能表達足夠的意義，通常比較長的名稱好，儘量減少再命名上不必要的文字 不要用變數型態作為變數名稱 e.g., accountList → accountGroup or accounts 要區別名稱，用 讀者能分辨的區別方式 ！！！ e.g., moneyAmount → money customerInfo → customer 命名的長度應該要與 scope 大小對應 一個常用到的變數或常數，最好給它一個容易被搜尋的名子 詞性 class, object → 名詞 method → 動詞 替單一的概念選一個詞 e.g., get, fetch, retrieve 混用是一件很糟的事 避免用雙關語，或可以表達兩個意思的字 e.g., 加入一個新的值 : add → append, insert 第3章：函式 寫一個好的函式有兩個守則 簡短 比簡短來得更簡短 準則 每行應該少於150字，函式應該少於20行 但最重要的是， 每個函式都要能清楚的告訴你本身的意圖，並帶領你到下個函式 別去害怕取較長的函數名稱 長但具描述性質 > 註解 > 短而無法理解 降層準則： 由上而下閱讀的程式 Don't repeat yourself at any cost!!! if, else, while 這些敘述最好都只有一行，而那行通常是函式呼叫 避免巢狀結構， 函式內的縮排不該超過一或兩層 函式應該做一件事情，他們應該把這件事做好。而且只做好這件事 做一件事的函式不應該被合理的分成不同的段落 (e.g., 宣告區, 初始區... and etc.) 函式要能 做好某件事 ，或 回答某個問題 ，而這代表 兩者不該同時發生！！！ if ( set ( \"username\" , \"bob\" )) ...... // refactored if ( attrExists ( \"userName\" )) { setAttr ( \"userName\" , \"bob\" ); } 錯誤處理 用例外處理取代錯誤碼回傳 而錯誤處理是會混淆程式結構的，比較好的作法就是把 try catch 區塊提出來 if ( deletePage ( page ) == E_OK ) { if ( registry . deleteReference ( page . name ) == E_OK ) { if ( configKeys . deleteKey ( page . name . makeKey ()) == E_OK ) { logger . log ( \"page deleted\" ); } else { logger . log ( \"configKey not delete\" ) } } else { logger . log ( \"deleteReference from registry failed\" ) } } else { logger . log ( \"delete failed\" ); } // refactored try { deletePage ( page ); registry . deleteReference ( page . name ); configKeys . deleteKey ( page . name . makeKey ()); } catch ( Exception e ) { logger . log ( e . getMessage ()); } // even more refactored public void delete ( Page page ) { try { deletePageAndAllReferences ( page ); } catch ( Exception e ) { logError ( e ); } } private void deletePageAndAllReferences ( Page page ) throws Exception { deletePage ( page ); registry . deleteReference ( page . name ); configKeys . deleteKey ( page . name . makeKey ()); } private void logError ( Exception e ) { logger . log ( e . getMessage ()); } 參數 函式最好是不使用到參數，可以的話不要超過3個 除非有非常特殊的理由，否則都不該超過3個 別傳flag參數(e.g. isSutie)進入函式 ，那代表這個函式一定做超過一件事！！！ 單一參數函式 問與這個參數有關的問題 (e.g., fileExists(\"MyFile\")) 對這個參數進行操作，並且 回傳 事件，利用參數去改變系統的狀態 2 ~ 3 個參數 注意參數順序性 利用建立物件的方式，減少函式參數的數量 Circle makeCircle ( double x , double y , double radius ); // refactored Circle makeCirecle ( POoint center , double radiue ); 避免使用輸出型參數，這十分的讓人困惑 appendFooter ( s ); // refactored s . appendFooter (); 如何寫出這樣函式？？？ 一直修改和重構，直到足夠精簡 不用一開始就要寫到最精簡，實際上那也是辦不到的 第4章：註解 不要替糟糕的程式碼寫註解 ─ 重寫它！！！ 與其花時間在寫註解來解釋混亂的程式碼，不如花時間去整理它! 即使是適當的使用註解，也只是用來彌補程式碼表達意思的失敗 每次要寫註解時，先思考是否能 直接用程式碼表達 註解只應該描述附近的程式碼，不要在區域性註解內放入系統全域資訊 替只做一件事的小函式選一個好名稱，多半比將註解寫在函式標頭優雅 有用的註解 提供資訊的註解 //format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy Pattern tiMatcher = Pattern . compile ( \"\\\\d*:\\\\d*:\\\\d* \\\\w*, \\\\w* \\\\d*, \\\\d*\" ) 對後果的告誡： 警告會出現某種特殊後果的註解 TODO 公開 API 中的 Javadoc 糟糕的註解 大部分的註解 多餘的註解： 沒比程式碼本身透露更多資訊的註解 class Person () { # The name of this person private String name ; } 每個函式，每個變數都該有註解來說明 。 不，別這麼做 把暫時無用的程式碼註解掉並留著，是很惱人的 → 版本控制會幫我們記下它 第5章：編排 選擇一些簡單的縮排規則，並持續的運用它 如果在一個團隊，所有成員都該依循著一套統一的編排規則 團隊合作時，事先決定編排方式是值得的 該在哪裡放括號 縮排寬度多少 如何命名變數、類別、方法 編排是一種溝通方式，可以嚴重影響可讀性，所以我們要很重視它 垂直邊排： 一份程式檔大概多長比較好？ 一份重要的大型專案也可以在大多數程式檔都只有200行左右的情況下完成 這沒有硬性規定。但要知道 簡短的程式檔總是比大型的程式檔容易理解 變數應該被宣告在接近它被使用的地方 區域變數應該在函式的最上方被宣告 迴圈的控制變數應該在回圈敘述內宣告 函式間的編排 如果一個函式呼叫了另一個函式，這個函式最好放在被呼叫函式的上方 概念高度相似的函式也應該垂直的放在一起 也許是類似的命名或相同工作的變異版本，就算沒相互呼叫，還是應該放在一起 談到了垂直的寬度後，那水平的寬度呢? 雖然我們喜歡較短的程式碼，但只要是 不需要用到捲軸捲到右方就可以稱為適當的寬度 有時候if, while或簡單的函式，可以被縮減為一行，讓我們違反一般的縮排規則， 不建議這麼做 public String render () throws Exception { return \"\" ;} //better public String render () throws Exception { return \"\" ; } 使用空行、空白 每一段程式碼都代表一個完整思緒，而我們用空行來區隔它們 而如果程式碼們是相關的，它們就該是垂直緊密的 相似的概念應該要放在同一份檔案中 我們用水平的空白來區分高度和低度相關的概念，也可以作為強調用，下面的程式碼是書中一個很棒的例子 注意到return那行，這裡用空格來強調運算子的優先權 public class Quadratic { public static double root1 ( double a , double b , double c ) { double determinant = determinant ( a , b , c ); return (- b + Math . sqrt ( determinant )) / ( 2 * a ); } ...... } 第6章：物件及資料結構 資料結構容易新增函式，而物件容易增加新類別。 反之亦然 模組不該知道它操作的物件的內部操作 別使用一連串的程式呼叫 final String outputDir = ctxt . getOptions (). getScratchDir (). getAbsolutePaty (); //refactored Option opts = ctxt . getOptions (); File scratchDir = opts . getScractchDir (); final String outputDir = scratchDir . getAbsolutePath (); 第7章：錯誤處理 錯誤處理常大量存在於程式碼中 它很重要，但別讓它混亂你的程式碼 例外處理應該要能提供 有用的錯誤訊息 ， e.g, 哪裡發生錯誤、錯誤型態是什麼 別回傳 null，試著拋出例外事件是更好的作法 函式回傳 null 已經夠糟了，但傳遞 null 進去更是糟糕透頂 從呼叫者的角度定義例外class，這裡有個書上很棒的例子 這種技巧被稱為Wrapper，這樣的技巧可以使依賴減少 ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort ( 12 ); try { port . open (); } catch ( DeviceResponseException e ) { reportPortError ( e ); logger . log ( \"Device reponse exception\" , \"e\" ); } catch ( ATM1212UnlockedException e ) { reportPortError ( e ); logger . log ( \"ATM1212UnlockedException\" ); } catch ( HMXError e ) { reportPortError ( e ); logger . log ( \"Device response exception\" ); } finally { ... } // refactored LocalPort port = new LocalPort ( 12 ); try { port . open (); } catch ( PortDeviceFailure e ) { reportPortError ( e ); logger . log ( e . getMessage , e ); } public class LocalPort { private ACMEPort innerPort ; public LocalPort ( int portNumber ) { innerPort = new ACMEPort ( portNumber ); } public void open () { try { innerPort . open (); } catch ( DeviceResponseException e ) { throw new PortDeviceFailure ( e ); } catch ( ATM1212UnlockedException e ) { throw new PortDeviceFailure ( e ); } catch ( GMXError e ) { throw new PortDeviceFailure ( e ); } } } 第8章：邊界 學習型測試： 不要在產品程式裡實驗新的東西，而是另外寫測試程式，來了解第三方軟體 學習型測試不會花我們太多時間，而且能用來 確認第三方軟體是否能照我們預期的執行 如果沒有這種 邊界測試 來減輕版本更新時的整合負擔，我們 只能一直停留在舊的版本 避免我們的程式過度的使用第三方軟體的特殊之處，最好是依靠在你可以控制的程式之上。免得到最後反而受到第三方軟體的控制 第9章：單元測試 為什麼要寫測試？ 測試讓程式保有彈性 有了測試，就不會怕修改程式會造成程式的結果不如預期 測試程式跟產品程式一樣重要，一樣需要整潔 醜陋的測試程式，如果沒讓程式更糟，最多也只是跟沒有測試程式一樣 什麼東西造就了一個整潔的測試程式？ → 可讀性 但是測試程式並不需要產品程式一樣的有效率 整潔測試程式的5個原則 F.I.R.S.T. Fast: 能快速的被執行 Independent: 測試程式不該相互依賴 Repeatable: 應該要可以再任何環境重複執行 Self-Validating: 應該輸出 boolean 。你不該手動比較兩個檔案才知道有沒有通過測試 Timely: 單元測試要在恰好能使其通過的產品程式之前不久撰寫 BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK 建立測試資料 操作測試資料 檢查「操作測試資料」後的結果是否如預期 一個測試只能有一個assert 有必要嗎? 更好的方法是 一個測試只測試一個概念 TDD (Test Driven Development) 三大法則 在撰寫一個單元測試前，不可撰寫任何產品程式 只撰寫剛好無法通過的單元測試，不能編譯也算無法通過 只撰寫剛好能通過當前測試的產品程式 第10章：類別 Java的慣例 類別以變數開頭 public static final → private static → private >>>>> public (幾乎很少有理由要用到) public 函式緊跟在變數 private 的工具函式，會跟在呼叫它的函式後 不用過度執著於封裝，有時候為了讓測試程式存取， protected 是必要的 設計程式時，一次只專注在「讓程式運作」或「讓程式整潔」之一，而兩者是同樣重要的 系統應該要由很多小的 class 組成，而不是少數的大 class 組成 我們架構的系統，在未來想新增或修改功能時，應該要儘可能不動到其他程式碼 開放閉合原則 類別應該要對擴充有開放性，對修改有封閉性 相依性反向原則 類別應該要相依於抽象概念，而不是相依在具體細節 職責 class 除了簡短還是要簡短 在函式我們計算行數，class算的是 職責的數量 class的命名要能足夠描寫他的職責 如果無法取個明確的名稱，這個 class 可能就太大了 模稜兩可的名稱，代表 class 可能包含愈多的職責，而這是我們不希望的 用 25 個字詞為這個 class 寫出簡短的描述，而不使用到模糊的字眼，這樣的 class 就是職責數量恰當 單一職責原則 一個 class 或 module 應該有也只能有一個修改的理由 凝聚性 class 只應該要有少量的實體變數， class 的每個方法都應該操作一個或更多這些變數 不用也不太可能產生最大凝聚性類別 但當凝聚性增加，就代表方法和變數結合成一個邏輯的整體，這是我們所希望的 class 累積越來越多實體變數，但只有少數函式操作著他們，就會開始喪失凝聚性 而這就是我們應該拆開 class 的時候了！！！ 我們不重新撰寫程式，而是改變它 先寫好一套驗證的測試程式，一次一個地改變 每一次變動都重新驗證是否如預期執行 重構完成","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/the-clean-code","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/the-clean-code"},{"title":"[Note] The Clean Coder","text":"過了幾年又重新看過這本書才慢慢能感受到裡面說的 Uncle Bob 的書真的每個階段看都會有很不一樣的感覺 很值得買回來收 xD 幾年前第一次看這本書的時候 寫程式大多只是交作業，頂多就跟其他的同學一起交大一點的作業或開發一些小專案 能不要被雷（或不要雷別人）就很不錯了 當時記錄下的摘要也就沒什麼內容（ [Book] Clean Coder ） 到了現在。加減算是做過稍微大一點的專案，也帶過一些小專案 重新看過這本書，就慢慢理解了一點 Uncle Bob 想說的 關於本書 什麼是軟體專業人士？ 軟體專業人士如何行事？ 軟體專業人士如何處理衝突，「應對」緊湊的開發進度表？如何和不切實際的管理人員打交道？ 軟體專業人士何時應該說「不」？怎麼說？ 軟體專業人士如何「應對」壓力？ 第一章：專業主義 擔當責任 專業人士如果犯了錯，只好 自己 收拾殘局 專業主義就代表著 「擔當責任」 你說的沒錯。軟體發展太複雜了，不可能沒什麼Bug。但很不幸，這個理由並不能為你開脫。人體太複雜了，不可能完全理解，但醫生仍誓言不傷害病人。如果他們不拿人體的複雜性做託辭，我們又怎麼能拿上述理由，開脫自已的責任呢？ 程式難免出現 bug ，但這不意味著你不用對他們負責；沒人能寫出完美的軟體，但這不代表你不用對不完美負責。 每次 QA 找出問題時，或者更糟糕的是「用戶找出問題」時，你都該震驚羞愧，並決心以此為戒。 自動化測試 寫一些隨時都能執行的「單元測試」，然後盡可能地多執行 要測試多少程式碼呢？ → 當然是全部！全部都要測！ 但有些程式碼不是很難測嗎？ 沒錯。但之所以難測，是因為設計時沒考慮如何測試 唯一的解決辦法就是要設計 「易於測試的程式碼」 結構 想證明軟體易於修改，唯一的辦法就是「做些實際的修改」 如果發現這些修改不如想像中簡單，就應該改進設計，讓後續的改變更簡單 職業道德 你應該計畫每週的60小時中 40小時給雇主 20小時給自己 （大約每天 3 小時） 不為雇主工作，為自己的職業發展工作 了解你的領域 每個專業軟體發展人員 至少 必須精通的事項 Design patterns GOF POSA Design principles SOLID Methods XP Scrum Lean Kanban Waterflow 結構化分析 結構化設計 and etc. Disciplines TDD 物件導向設計 結構化程式設計 CI Pair Programming Artifacts UML DFD (Data Flow Diagram) 結構圖 Petri net 狀態遷移圖表 流程圖 決策表 學習 自我學習 讀書, 關注 blog, tweets, 參加 conference, 訪問用戶群, 參與讀書會 and etc. 協作 輔導 專業人士會「視輔導新人為己任」，他們不會放任未經輔導的新手胡打亂撞 了解業務領域 如果撰寫財務系統，你就該對財務領域有所了解 你未必要成為該領域的專家，但你仍需要勤勉，付出相當的努力來認識業務領域。 最不專業的做法是，只簡單地按照規格說明來撰寫程式碼，但卻對於那些業務為什麼需要做那樣的規格定義不求甚解。相反的，你應該對該領域有所瞭解，能辨別、執行規格說明書的錯誤 第二章：説「不」 Do or do not ! There is no try! —— Yoda 專業人士敢於說明真相而不屈從於權勢。專業人士有勇氣對他們的經理說「不」。 難道不該照你老闆說的去做嗎？ 不該。只要你是一名專業人士，那就不該 奴隸沒有權利說「不」。勞工或許也對說「不」有所顧慮。但是專業人士應該懂得說「不」 你的經理要求你在明天之前完成登入頁面，這就是他在追求和捍衛的一個目標，那是他的工作職責。如果你明知第二天之前不可能完成登入頁面，嘴上卻說「好的，我會試試看」，那麼便是你失職了。這時候，唯一盡責的方式便是說「不，這不可能」 可能得最好結果 是你和你的經理共同追求的目標。 最關鍵的是要找到那個「共同目標」，而這往往有賴於「協商」。 「為什麼」重要嗎？ 如果你的主管恰好有「技術背景」和「好脾氣」去傾聽理解，這些解釋也許有用 另一種狀況是，主管會不認同這樣的結論或做法不對，可能會說出不用做完整的測試和程式碼審核 有時候，提供太多細節，只會變成一個口令一個動作的管理方式。 第三章：説「是」 作出承諾包含三步驟 口頭上說自己將會去做 心裡認真對待自己所做出的能諾 真的付諸行動去做 識別「缺乏承諾」的徵兆 need / should 我們需要把這工作做完 我需要減肥 有人應當負責去推動這件事 hope / wish 希望明天我能完成這個任務 希望改天我們能見宴嗎 但願我有時間做這件事 但願電腦更快點 Let's (而不是「讓我」) 讓我們回頭見 讓我們把這工作做完 真正的承諾聽起來是怎樣的 我將在...之前... e.g., 我將在星期二之前完成這個任務 你對自己會做某件事做了清晰的事實陳述，而且還明確說明了完成期限 之所以沒成功，是因為我寄望於某某人去做這件事 你只能承諾自己能 完全掌控 的事 如果最終目標依賴於他人，那麼你就應該採取些具體行動以接近最終目標 之所以沒成功，是因為有些時候我真的無能為力 如果你無法兌現承諾，那麼最重要的就是「儘早向你承諾對象發聲預警，越快越好，越早越好」。 如果你不儘早告訴他人可能的問題，就錯失了讓他們幫你兌現能諾的機會。 第四章：寫程式 做好準備 寫程式是件累人的事，你必須做到 讓程式碼能正常工作。理解當前要解決的問題和如何解決，並且確保程式碼忠實的依循解決方案 幫客戶解決問題 很多時候，客戶提出的需求其實並不能真正解決他們自己的問題。這有賴於你去發現這些問題並與客戶交流，以確保能滿足客戶的真實需求 。 程式碼必須和現有系統整合，並妥善管理好各種相依關係，不能讓系統僵化 寫程式時必須遵循穩工程原則 其他的程式設計師必須能讀懂你的程式碼 這包括寫好註解、精心淬煉程式碼，這可能是程式設計師最難精通的一項。 感到疲勞或心煩意亂， 千萬別寫程式 奉獻精神和職業素養更主要的意義在於「遵守紀律原則」而非成為「長時間的工作狂」 要確保自己已經幾睡眠、健康和生活方式調整到最佳狀態，這樣才能做到每天的8小時工作時間內 全力以赴 創意輸入 「創意輸出」依賴於「創意出入」 → 廣泛閱讀 保持節奏、知道何時應該離開一會 軟體開發是一場馬拉松，不是短跑衝刺 沒解決這個問題不能回家 噢不，你可以回家，而且是應該回家！ 創意和智力來自於大腦的高速運轉，當你感到疲勞時，它們就不翼而飛了 進度延遲 即使是最優秀的程式設計師、最敬業的員工，也不能避免碰到延遲 管理延遲的要訣就是 早期檢測和保持透明 根據目標定期衡量進度，使用三個考慮到各種因素的期限， 不要把預估和期望混淆在一起 樂觀預估, 常態預估, 悲觀預估 不要經受不住誘惑盲目衝刺 你無法更快的寫完程式碼。試圖這麼做，最終只會讓自己變得更慢，同時也只能製造出一堆混亂，讓其他人也慢下來 交付失敗 程式設計師所能表現的不專業中，最糟糕的就是，明知道還沒有完成任務卻宣稱已經完成 明確定義「完成」 最好的方法是讓業務分析師和測試人員建立一套自動化的驗收測試，只有完全通過這些驗收測試，開發任務才能算已經完成 幫助 作為專業人士，你要以能隨時幫助別人為榮 你的工作不可能重要到你不能花一丁點時間來幫助別人 這並不是說你不需要獨處的時間 → 直接、禮貌的讓人知道某個時間區段不希望受到干擾，其餘的時段敞開大門樂於幫助他人 要學會如何請求幫助 輔導 花時間親自輔導手底下的年輕程式設計師，是資深程式設計師的「專業職責所在」 同樣的道理，向資深導師尋求輔導，也是年輕程式設計師的「專業職責」 第五章：測試驅動開發 TDD 的三大法則 在撰寫一個單元測試（測試失敗的單元測試）前，不可撰寫任何產品程式 只撰寫剛好無法通過的單元測試，不能編譯也算無法通過 只撰寫剛好能通過當前測試失敗的產品程式 TDD 的優勢 確定性 缺陷注入率 勇氣 擁有一套值得信賴的測試，便可完全打消對修改程式碼的全部恐懼。當看見糟糕的程式碼時，就可以放手整理 文件 單元測試就是文件。他們描述了系統的最底層設計細節 設計 基於測試先行的需要，會迫使你去思考什麼才是 好的設計 與採用測試先行方式編寫的測試程式碼比起來，後寫的測試在深度和捕捉錯誤的靈敏度方面要遜色很多 第六章：練習 自身經驗的拓展 老闆通常只會限定一種語言、一種平台，以及程式設計師工作目標的專業領域。這樣會導致經驗不夠豐富的程式設計師，其領域和思維都被侷限 程式設計師發現，面對這個行業的週期性變化造成的新局面，自己並沒有做好準備 保持不落伍的一種方法是為 open source project 貢獻程式碼 嘗試對自己不習慣的語言、平台、領域做出貢獻 第七章：驗收測試 定義驗收測試 「業務方與開發方合作編寫的測試」，其目的在於確認需求已經完成了 「完成」意味著 所有程式碼都寫完了 所有的測試都通過了 QA 和需求方已經認可 測試的協商與被動推進 身為專業開發人員，「與撰寫測試的人協商並改進測試」是你的職責。絕不能被動接受測試，更不能對自己說：「噢，測試就是這麼要求的，我又得這麼做。」 層級 對象 單元測試 系統內部 呼叫特定類別方法 驗收測試 系統外部 通常在 API 或 UI 層級進行 結論 細節交流是件麻煩事。尤其開發方和業務方交流關於程式的細節時，更是如此。 通常，各方握手言歡，以為其他人都明白自己的意思。雙方以為取得了共識，然後帶著截然不同的想法離開，這種事屢見不顯。 要解決開發方和業務方的溝通問題，我 (Uncle Bob) 所知道的唯一有效辦法是「編寫自動化的驗收測試」。 第八章：測試策略 職位 測試面向 業務人員 正常路徑測試 (happy-pathtest) QA 包含極端狀況 (corner)、邊界條件 (boundary)的異常路徑測試(unhappy-path) 自動化測試金字塔 測試 覆蓋率 測試介面 人工探索式測試 ~5% 系統測試 ~10% gui 整合測試 ~20% api 元件測試 ~50% api 單元測試 ~100% 單元測試 目的： 在最低層次上定義系統 先寫測試，在寫程式碼 這些應該作為 CI 的一部分執行，以確保程式設計師的程式碼意圖沒有遭到破壞 元件測試 需要使用合適的 mocking 或 test-doubling，解開「系統和其他元件」的耦合 由 QA 和業務人員編寫，開發人員提供輔助 整合測試 目的： 確認系統架構層面結構正確 只對元件很多的較大型系統才具有意義 由系統架構師或 lead designers 來編寫 系統測試 針對「整個整合完畢的系統」來執行的自動化測試 不會直接測試業務規則，而是測試系統是否以正確組裝完畢 應包含產能測試和性能測試 由系統架構師和 technical leads 來編寫 人工探索式測試 目的： 驗證預期行為時，探索系統預期以外的行為 第九章：時間管理 會議 關於會議，有兩條真理 會議是必須的 會議浪費了大量的時間 離席 仔細管理自己的時間是你的責任。如果你發現參加某個會議是在浪費時間，就應當想個禮貌的辦法出來 顯然，你不該大喊「這會議真讓人厭煩」，沒有必要採取粗魯的辦法。可以選個適當時機來問問大家，你的出席是否必要。你可以解釋說，自己抽不出更多的時間用於這場會議，問問有沒有辦法加快討論，或者另選時間 繼續參加對你沒有太多意義的會議，是不專業的行為 爭論 / 反對 如果觀點無法在短時間（5 ~ 30 分鐘）內達成一致，就永遠無法達成一致 唯一的解決方法是「去取得資料，讓資料來說話」 「既然其他人想要這樣做，就這麼做吧」這可能是非專業的行為中最糟糕的了，千萬千萬不要這麼做 如果你同意了，就 必須 拿出行動來 專注力 Manna 專注力是稀有的資源 如果你用光了自己的專注力 Manna，必須花一個小時或更多時間做不需要專注力的事情來補充它 專業開發人員會安排好他們的睡眠，保證清晨有飽滿的專注力 Manna 去上班 肌肉專注力有助於改善新制專注力，而不僅僅是簡單恢復 定期訓練肌肉專注力，可以提升心智專注力的上限 要避免的行為 優先順序錯亂 無論什麼原因，我們都可以找到辦法逃避真正的工作。提高某項任務的優先順序，之後就有藉口延後真正急迫的任務 專業開發人員會評估每項任務的優先順序，排除個人的喜好和需求，按照真實的緊急程度來執行任務 死胡同 專業開發人員不會執著於不容放棄也無法繞開的 idea。他們會保持開放的頭腦來聽取其他建議，所以即便走到盡頭，他們仍然有選擇 第10章：預估 承諾 v.s. 預估 承諾是必須做到的 預估是一種「猜測」，不帶任何承諾的色彩。之所以要預估，是因為不知道要花多少時間 PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) 三元分析法 O: Optimistic Estimate 一切都很順利的完成時間 N: Nominal Estimate 一般來說的完成時間 P: Pessimistic Estimate 遇到各種意外地完成時間 $ \\mu = \\frac{O+4N+P}{6} $ 任務期望完成的時間 $ \\sigma = \\frac{P-O}{6} $ 任務完成機率分布的標準差 大數法則 把大任務分成許多小任務，分開預估再加總，結果會比單獨評估大任務要精確得多 第11章：壓力 避免壓力 承諾 避免對「沒有把握達成最後期限的工作」做出「承諾」 業務方總是期望能夠拿到這些承諾，因為他們想消除風險。我們要做的就是日風險量會，必將他們陳述給業務方，這樣他們就能做好相對的準備。 有時，有人會代我們做出承諾 出於責任感，我們必須主動協助找到方法來兌現這些承諾，但是一定 不能接受 這些承諾 危機中的紀律 如果在危機中你改變了行為，就說明你並不是真的相信常規行為中的紀律 如果在平時你會注意程式碼整潔，但在危機時刻，你卻會產出髒亂的程式碼，就說明你並不真正相信混亂會導致速度下降 應對壓力 不要驚慌失措 溝通 讓你的團隊或主管知道你身陷困境。告訴他們你為走出困境置地的最佳計畫。請求他們的支援與指引。避免製造意料之外的詫異 依靠你的紀律原則 依靠那些你已經知道確實有效的東西 - 你平時遵守的紀律 尋求幫助 Pair Programming 第12章：協作 專業程式設計師的主要職責是滿足雇主的需求 這意味著要含你的經理們、業務分析師們、測試工程師們和其他團隊成員有良好的協作，並且 深刻理解 業務項目 你需要理解 「手上正在撰寫的程式碼，其業務價值是什麼」 ，了解雇用你的企業將如何從你的工作中獲得回報 「需要長時間努力思考一個問題」、「任務極為簡單、和另一個人一起工作變成一種浪費」時單獨工作是正確的 但一般來說和其他人緊密協作、大部分時間採取 Pair Programming 是最好的作法 程式設計意味著「與人協作」 我們需要和業務人員一起工作，我們之間也需要互相合作 第13章：團隊與專案 形成有凝聚力的團隊是需要時間的 可能需要6個月，甚至是1年 團隊成員首先要建立關係。他們需要學習如何互相協作，需要瞭解彼此的癖好、強項、弱項，最終才能 凝聚成 團隊 有凝聚力的團隊通常有12名成員，多可以有20人，最少可以只有3人 e.g., 12名 7名程式設計師 2名測試人員： 編寫「自動化測試」確認程式正確性 2名分析師： 開發「需求」，為需求編寫「自動化測試」確認業務價值正確 1名專案經理： 跟蹤團隊的「進度」，確保成員理解「專案時間表」和「優先順序」 團隊比專案更難建置 組織穩健的團隊，讓團隊在一個又一個專案中整體移動、共同工作是較好的做法 團隊有了凝聚力，但卻因為專案結束了便將這樣的團隊解散，是極為荒謬可笑的做法 第14章：輔導、學徒期與工藝典範 學校能夠傳授的是電腦程式設計的理論 但學校並不會、也無法傳授作為一名程式設計工匠所需要掌握的原則、實踐和技能 這些東西只有經由師徒個體間多年的細心監督和輔導才能獲得 Appendix A: 工具 Source code control e.g., git IDE / Editor e.g., vi, emacs, IntelliJ, TextMate 問題追蹤 e.g., Pivotal Tracker, Lighthouse, wiki, Board (To-Do/ Doing/ Done) CI e.g., Jenkins 單元測試工具 快速便捷的執行測試 在通過或失敗要有清楚的視覺提示 對於測試進度也要有清楚的視覺提示 避免 test cases 之間的彼此通訊 讓編寫測試變得容易 元件測試工具 理想的情況是「業務分析師和QA」能夠使用這些工具來 編寫 規約 e.g, FitNesse, RobotFX, Cucumber 整合測試工具 e.g., Selenium, Watir UML / MDA","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/the-clean-coder","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/the-clean-coder"},{"title":"[Book] 告別菜尾時代","text":"The plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people.

Orr 第一篇：如果舒適圈一點也不舒服 「再重新想一遍。你認為的舒適圈，真的舒適嗎？」 有些人會說，那是因為他們有錢，才能夠擺脫「飢餓威脅」。 可是我的好友M就曾憂心忡忡地告訴我，他身上有龐大的貸款要償還：瑞典人Ｎ在找房子時，也說他沒辦法租太昂貴的房子，因為每個月能花的費用有限：澳洲人S也總是在研究空擋去醫院兼職打工。 這些人並非是天之驕子，都是跟你我一樣為了錢而煩惱的凡人，但他們卻勇於暫時放下外人或自己人生的「飢餓威脅」，嘗試走到世界闖一闖。 美國人Ｍ與Ｋ就告訴過我，若不是在南美、非洲的那幾年，他們不會知道自己想成為一個怎樣的醫生。 You Are In Your Time Zone. 比起年齡，更應該焦慮的是 - 有沒有在做自已喜歡的事 不要用已經付出的「沈沒成本」來限制人生的決定 美國的學校最喜歡能展現領導力的學生，且招生標語總是希望培育出「未來領導人」，因此，進了美國職場後，就算我是整個實驗室裡輩份最小的，同事和老闆也總是告誡我：「 我們要你未來也能成為領導人。千萬不要小看自己，人總是會往上爬，有一天你也會成為主管，而我們希望到那個時候你是『準備好的』 」。由此可知，他們不只把我當個「員工」而已 ，還會花時間教我各種領導能力，例如，有效運用自己的時間，學會取捨、面對無謂的要求要懂得說「不」、學著主持會議、還教我如何與其他老闆社交......等。 如果你因為旁人的負面思考與意見被侷限而不放膽嘗試，那麼，你的最佳狀態就只會是現在的模樣，不會再進步了。 對未來缺乏想像力這件事，或許不能完全怪在台灣的學生身上...... 如果你沒有看過別人成為什麼，便很難去想像自己可以成為什麼 。 「你應該要先去想想，二、三十年後，你想成為一個怎麼樣的人？為了成為這樣的人，十五年後應該要達成什麼樣的位置？又必須做出多少的努力，才能達到二、三十年的目標？以此回推，如果要達成十五年的位置，那麼到了第十年你該做些什麼？第五年呢？第一年呢？ 慢慢逐步推回來。因此你現在應該要為了一年後，做什麼努力？ 」 他點出了我們應該要先放膽去想，二、三十年後想做什麼？然後再慢慢回推現在該做什麼努力，而非以現在能看到的視野、擁有的資源，規劃我們三十年後想成為的樣子。 第二篇：只要敢闖，世界就是你的 聯合國與哈佛的面試： 你的 Commitment 是什麼？ 我還特地問他（組織內的行政助理）：「難道美國人/西方人比較看重承諾？畢竟我過去從未在面試時被問到這樣的問題，就連我進醫學系的時候也沒有。」 他說：「真的！因為 Commitment 是個很慎重的字。」他沈默了也思考一下，然後說：「我的人生中還沒有在面試時被問到這個問題，但我可以想見， 我們(哈佛大學)或聯合國想要找到對於這個世界有熱情、有理想的申請者，才會在面試的時候這麼詢問。 」 第三篇：站在語言、文化與價值觀的十字路口 當你開始在異鄉生活，英文就再也不是考試上那一題題的單選或複選題了，而是工作、讀書，或是生活上的溝通「工具」。就英文程度需求最低的生活層面來看，如果你到了另一個國家，無法聽得懂對方的解釋，又無法清楚表達自己的想法，那麼，在國外吃虧時，該要如何幫自己爭取權益呢？ 第四篇：在地球的另一端，從異鄉看家鄉 只用旅行構成的世界觀並不完整 因為在旅行途中，大部分的時間是快樂的，然而，在當地生活是酸甜苦樂並存的，甚至是時間的苦悶。 透過長住的機會，使我有不一樣的「成長」。這個「成長」，來自於我每天使用非母語的語言，每天努力融入另一個族群的文化、每天拼了命去學習全新的思考模式，然後在空閒時間，好好看著離家半個地球遠的當地風景。 有一位我十分敬重的某 NGO 創辦人來台灣演講時，有學生問他：「如果我有四萬元，你希望我把四萬元捐給你？還是希望我用四萬元買一張機票，去看看你所創建的孤兒院呢？」 NGO創辦人豪不猶豫地說：「 我希望你買一張機票來看看，因為當你買了那張機票，你才會明白我所說的一切貧窮、困苦都是真的。你會把這些震撼與故事帶回到你的生命裡，然後，我要你用你那四萬塊的機票，發揮你生命的影響力，把故事傳出去，讓更多人知道什麼是貧窮，在貧窮裡生活又是如何超乎你原本生活想像的艱難。 」 往後，我看到許多偏鄉志工、國際志工，不論是捐錢、捐物資等，也有相似的行為漠視：半吊子的助人，認為「有幫總比沒幫好」，或是助人後，完全不檢討自己的行為是否為對方帶來傷害、是否有改善的空間，也因此，我開始深刻的體會「做好事，不是只有善意就好」。 Cambodia's Orphanage Business Ethiopia food aid dependency 為善，應該要更柔軟與敏感 心存善念幫助他人的同時，不要只憑一股衝勁去做，完全缺乏事前的評估，也沒有細心調查服務對象的需求，更不要在事後，完全沒有檢討、追蹤與改善。 這就好像待人處事一樣，是需要互相尊重與同理心的，更不是自己的地位比受助人高。別忘了，今天的你只是相對幸運，能夠擁有比較多的資源，説不定，有天你也可能會成為需要幫助的人。行善之前，請試著多想一些。 尤其做好事的人，內心往往要比一般人更柔軟與敏感才是。 The road to hell is paved with good intensions. 同場加映作者的文章: 「愛台灣，就是畢業了先不要回來。」──現在我明白，這句話背後的沉重","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2018/11/it-s-time-for-the-young-generation","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2018/11/it-s-time-for-the-young-generation"},{"title":"MOPCON 2018","text":"今年其實是因為拿到去年講者用不到的邀請票才來參加的 xD 總結來說，我覺得這趟來還算是蠻有收穫的 幾年前有去過一次 MOPCON 也許是去慣了台北的研討會都在中研院豪華的場地，就覺得 MOPCON 的場地很普通 （其實連國際級的會議 EDBT 的場地都沒中研院好呢 那年的議程也沒給我多大的收穫，之後就沒再來過了 兩天的會議下來，原本自己有做了一些筆記 但後來覺得自己保留一份筆記實在沒什麼意義... 共筆上面的內容還比我多，就把我自己的部分也都更新上共筆了 共筆連結 Day 1 第一天比較有趣的是 從菜鳥警察到資料戰警 , 用 Drone 改善團隊自動化測試及部署流程 原本讓我有考慮來 MOPCON 就是想來聽聽 Drone 的使用 不過果然還是要自己玩玩看才會知道怎麼用啊 xD 感覺聽這樣的 talk 大概就是讓我決定要不要花時間來試新工具 聽說還蠻多場都只是在介紹自家的產品的 還好我很巧妙的避開了（？？？ Day 2 第二天我就幾乎都在 Unconference 了 一般議程只聽了開頭 jserv 的 智慧電網背後的軟體建設 跟結尾的 Flutter 踩雷心得 其實會都待在 Unconference 也是一場意外 xD 原本想說還有五分鐘才正式議程，所以就先過去晃晃 但 創業的辛酸與奧義 實在太精彩了，就一直聽下去了 這場可是讓 Unconfernce 的場地全部坐滿，外面還圍了一整圈的人呢 接下來的 工程師與設計師都該知道的事 也很精彩 還好我有跑去 Dcard 的攤位跟講者要 slide 裡面的內容都還蠻有用的，但實在有點來不及作筆記 而且 Unconference 真的沒什麼人會去更新共筆 這場的整份筆記只有我在更新 QQ 最大的 takeaway 是 UI堆疊的太念 好像是來自 How to fix a bad user interface 這篇文章 Flutter 踩雷心得 也是出乎意料有趣的議程 Flutter 是一套可以拿來用在 iOS 和 Android 的框架 整場聽下來學到了不少 mobile 開發的知識 還有如何叫老闆買新電腦（誤 Lighting Talk 話說今年好像彩蛋題太難解，好多場 Lighting Talk 都在講要怎麼打 MOPCON 的官方 APP xDDD","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/mopcon-2018","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/11/mopcon-2018"},{"title":"[Book] 做孩子的重要他人","text":"跟蘇老師合作了半年下來 這還真的是我第一次真的有時間好好的看完這本書 第一次知道這本書大概是幾年前政大書城打得很大的標語 我的研究若做好，只幫了幾個人，但走入偏鄉，我要影響的是我們的下一代。 這本書交錯著蘇老師的成長歷程跟在偏鄉看到的事 我想大概還是偏鄉的那段故事比較吸引我 看著不同生長背景的人的故事，讓我更有能力去理解用不同方式去思考的人們 （ 同場加映： 做工的人 ） 我也同樣的記錄下，讓我比較有感的句子 許多人認為偏鄉的孩子沒有進取心，但問題可能在於我們不曾提供希望，讓他們知道向上爬的可能性。 我在教導程式書寫的過程中發現，如果我一味將孩子訓練成寫程式的工匠，而不讓他們知道為什麼要寫這些程式，將來他們只有當代工的命 - 在別人設定的規格下，做出別人要的制式化的東西。 因此訓練學生思考「現在面對的問題是什麼？」「如何解決這些問題」「電腦程式可以為解決這個問題幫上什麼忙？」甚至是「為什麼人們需要解決這種問題？」這一系列問題的替換，塑造他們思辯判斷的能力，才能培養出這個時代需要的領導人才。 孩子們需要的是長期的陪伴，蜻蜓點水式的關係，反而可能造成傷害。 真正的能者不會要求別人給你「公平」，反倒會努力爭取機會，把「公平」分給別人。 我們有什麼資格用「弱勢」二字來形容人家？說不定我們自己才是真的「弱勢」呢！ 裡面有些內容讓我想起去埔寨當國際志工的事 對我來說，那絕對是一趟收穫很多的經歷 但我是不是真的對當地帶來了幫助 回過頭來看，我對此是很懷疑的 我想反而是我從他們身上得到的還比較多 我們離開時，有人問當地的小朋友對我們的想法 我們突然來到他們的生活，卻又突然的離開 其實他們是很難過的，覺得我們這樣是很過分的 也許真的想要做些什麼，還是需要很長期的付出和陪伴 我們以為的幫助，反而卻帶來了傷害","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2018/10/be-someone-to-the-children","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2018/10/be-someone-to-the-children"},{"title":"Blog 風格修正","text":"一直以來都有發現 Blog 的風格有點小問題 但都懶得去好好地找出問題 這次終於下定決定修好它 起源其實是我的上一篇文被嘴了 QAQ 整理下來大概有三個問題 大小標的 margin 英文前後也空一格 第二行縮了四分之一字元 1. 大小標的 margin 這應該是三個問題中最簡單的 但我有點懶得動 CSS ，所以就先不修了 xD 2. 英文前後也空一格 剛好最近看到了 中文文案排版指北 才發現原來 「有研究顯示，打字的時候不喜歡在中文和英文之間加空格的人，感情路都走得很辛苦，有七成的比例會在 34 歲的時候跟自己不愛的人結婚，而其餘三成的人最後只能把遺產留給自己的貓。畢竟愛情跟書寫都需要適時地留白。與大家共勉之。」 ——vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing 總之，這也不是特別難處理的問題 只要透過 add-space-between-latin-and-cjk 再加上 os.walk() 就能解決了 不過還是會遇到一些不該加空格的地方，也被加空格了 但也只要用 git diff 再確認一下哪裡有被 script 修改過就可以了 3. 第二行縮了四分之一字元 這個問題就比較頭痛了 因為我在模板找到這段的內容是 {{ article.content }} 也就是説這個多的空白是 pelican (我用的 static blog generator) 所產生的 我沒有辦法透過單純的修改 HTML, CSS 來修正這個問題 必須要找到 pelican 是從哪產生出這個空白的 於是就開始我的 trace pelican 的之旅 接下來，就是一連串的 trace 過程 不想看可以透過 傳送門 直接跳到解法 pelican/readers.py (first try) 要找到 Markdown 是在哪被 parse 並產生內容的並不困難 ( pelican/readers.py 的 334行 ) 透過一些測試，發現這段的行為是因為有了多的 \\n 造成了多的空白 第一個猜想是某些情況下的 \\n 沒有成功的被移除掉 所以只要加一行 content.replace('\\n', '') 確保全部的 \\n 都被移除，應該就可以了 一開始問題也真的解決了 直到我用到 markdown中的 ``` 語法才又出現問題 在整個 code block 中的 code 全部都黏在一起沒有斷行 看來這個做法是行不通... 只好認命的從我平常產生文章的指令一步一步追回去 trace 的過程還有踩到一個雷是「pip 裝的 pelican 並不是 master 上的版本」 所以我還必須要切到 3.7.1版 才能開始解決我遇到的問題 setup.py 平常我都是透過 pelican -r -o output -s pelicanconf.py 這個指令來產生文章 所以第一步就是要從 setup.py 找出 pelican 這個指令是哪裡來的 ... 'pelican = pelican:main' , ... pelican/ init .py 既然在 pelican 這個 package 中沒有 main.py 那 Python 還能找到 main 就只剩下 __init__.py 扣除掉一些 parse 指令參數的程式碼 接下來最像是產生文章的程式碼就是 147行 的 run for p in generators : if hasattr ( p , 'generate_context' ): p . generate_context () 下一步就是要從 generators 找出 generate_context 這個函式 from pelican.generators import ( ArticlesGenerator , PagesGenerator , SourceFileGenerator , StaticGenerator , TemplatePagesGenerator ) pelican/generators.py generators 中看起來最有關的就是 ArticlesGenerator 這個 class 也找到了 generate_context try : article_or_draft = self . readers . read_file ( base_path = self . path , path = f , content_class = Article , context = self . context , preread_signal = signals . article_generator_preread , preread_sender = self , context_signal = signals . article_generator_context , context_sender = self ) 這裡找到的是文章被產生的地方 只要能在找到文章中的內容是在哪產生，應該就能解決我的問題 所以下一步就是要再去找到 Readers pelican/reader.py Readers 在這個檔案的 486行 接著 trace 這個 class 到 526行 就真的是文章內容第一次被產生的地方 到目前為止，文章的內容還是沒有多餘的空白 所以順利的話只要從這繼續 trace 下去就能找出問題 content , reader_metadata = self . get_cached_data ( path , ( None , None )) if content is None : content , reader_metadata = reader . read ( path ) self . cache_data ( path , ( content , reader_metadata )) 最後發現問題是出在 555行 if content : content = typogrify_wrapper ( content ) 只要不對 content 做 typogrify_wrapper 就不會產生多餘的空白 typogrify typogrify 是 pelicanconf.py (pelican 的設定檔) 中的一個設定 TYPOGRIFY = False 只要關掉 typogrify 就不會再產生出多餘的空白 typogrify 看來是某種加強 HTML 的工具 我試過要把 <br> 跟 &nbsp 加入 TYPOGRIFY_IGNORE_TAGS 不過看來還是沒辦法解決 最後只好把 typogrify 整個關掉了 後記 其實這也只是個無傷大雅的小問題 但真的是花了我不少時間才找到真正的問題所在 前幾次都能透過 trace 原始碼，找到 library 的一些小問題 也丟了幾個 Pull Request 不過看來這次沒能再多貢獻什麼 雖然好像有找到可能從 typogrify 解決掉這個 issue的方式 但要再把它加入 pelican 變成一種 config 還是有些麻煩 xD","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/10/fix-blog-style","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/10/fix-blog-style"},{"title":"X-Village 課程設計","text":"要一次說完整個 X-Village ，還是有點太花時間 先來聊聊我這次接觸到跟課程設計有關的部分 我在 X-Village 中，主要的工作還是在規劃、管理跟行政的部分 所以我要上的課也不多 跟課程相關，我接觸比較多的大概是這幾個部分 Review 「程式設計基石」(a.k.a. Python 課) 「資料結構」第三天下午的練習 「網頁開發、資料庫、雲端運算」第三天後半課程 1. Review 「程式設計基石」 課綱 起初，我和另一位核心助教規劃了 Python 課程的大綱 但這份課綱對初學者還是太難 因為身上處理的事在太多 這些工作就逐步派給其他助教 過了一週後，我們得到了一份更難了很多的課綱 xD 畢竟大家沒有太多的教學經驗 一開始就要設計好一份適當的課綱，本來就很困難 而且初期 Target Audience 一直不太明確 造成課程難度很難抓 陸續討論了幾週後，這就是我們正式課程前的版本 Topics Day 1 Opening Python Intro Editor Git Day 2 HackMD 淺談電腦基本運作 如何自己解決問題？ (Google, Stack Overflow) Python Basic(I) (Synyax, Data Types) Day 3 Function Module/Package Class Day 4 OOP Introduciton Day 5 Exception Handling File String Coding Convention Day 6 Recap Built-in Day 7 Regular Expression Python 套件管理 requests Day 8 Beautifulsoup Visualization Day 9 Decorator Iterator Generator Context Manager Day 10 Broaden Horizon Rehearsal Rehearsal 的時候，我看到了蠻多值得學習跟反省的地方 不愧是從醒獅團的人們，我看到了一些很有趣的教學方式 看著每個人不同的教學風格和內容 我在思考著 是不是有些人在以往學習程式上比較順利，比較知道如何自己找到解學辦法？ 對這樣的人來說，要如何把知識傳遞給學習不那麼快的人，就會需要比較多的學習 回想起我寫程式的歷程，可是一點都不順利 我在寫 Lisp 的時候，連 Syntax Highlight 都不懂 還要不斷數括號數量，才知道程式能不能跑的 e.g., (cond ((eq 'a 'b) 'first) (atom 'a) 'second)) （其實上面有少一個括號 xD） 課程正式開始 課程的前兩週因為在準備碩士論文口試 我沒有投入教學，也沒辦法整天跟課 但我中午跟晚上幾乎都會去 拿便當、飲料 關心課程狀況 課程開始後，我們要不斷看大家的狀況跟課後的回饋來調整課程的進度 因為這是密集課程 所謂的調整課程就是「今天馬上要改完，明天馬上就要上場」 而且助教們晚上也會留下來陪學員晚自習 造成大家幾乎是沒什麼休息的時間 因為第一次辦，完全無法預期大家的學習速度 只能先用一個版本出來教教看 再來看現場狀況隨時調整 不過有了這次的經驗，明年應該就比較有底了（如果還有明年的話 xD） 2. 「資料結構」第三天下午的練習 Exercise ipynb: DS-Exercise Day3 雖然先前大概有稍微想了一下準備怎樣的 Exercise 但我前一天下午才口試完 我其實只有大概一個晚上的時間準備 ... 可是「資料結構」的老師又是我找的 總覺得還是得要負起一些責任 早上的課程會由老師教理論，下午由助教來帶一些練習 我帶練習的那天早上則是教排序 在教學上我並沒花多少時間 就是帶了一些影片，讓大家 Recap 一下白天老師教的內容 我主要把時間都花在 Exercise 的設計上 Exercise4 用 Python 做排序 (ex4.py) some_list = [ 65 , 81 , 65 , 19 , 6 , 28 , 86 , 40 , 72 , 27 , 76 , 46 , 22 , 98 , 49 , 57 , 52 , 46 , 47 , 14 , 29 , 15 , 59 , 74 , 61 , 47 , 20 , 33 , 89 , 99 , 65 , 82 , 84 , 63 , 93 , 1 , 42 , 13 , 54 , 58 , 84 , 17 , 5 , 18 , 14 , 14 , 19 , 42 , 60 , 77 , 17 , 29 , 2 , 42 , 42 , 31 , 47 , 67 , 15 , 16 , 71 , 56 , 98 , 46 , 18 , 20 , 14 , 36 , 42 , 23 , 87 , 7 , 5 , 5 , 52 , 78 , 76 , 91 , 92 , 88 , 38 , 66 , 13 , 18 , 68 , 96 , 23 , 51 , 77 , 93 , 35 , 18 , 9 , 64 , 51 , 76 , 76 , 96 , 5 , 18 ] 寫過 Python 的人，一定馬上就會想到用 sort 或 sorted 但我故意把練習時間拉長到 20 分鐘 中間一直會有學員、助教問我「真的可以這樣寫嗎？」 恩，可以哦 在早上教完「資料結構」後，馬上帶這樣的練習 很容易讓人直接聯想到要實作排序演算法 我想帶來的想法是「在要下手去做什麼之前，先找找是不是有什麼現存的工具」 回想以前的我，肯定也是埋頭就下去硬幹 甚至我第一次用 Python 爬選課系統的時候，連 json 模組都不會用 只會照著 json 規定的格式，慢慢地做字串處理 e.g., json_str = '{\"' + course_name + '\": \"' + course_id + '\"}' 因為在我的 Knowledget Base，對函式庫的概念還是很模糊 也不知道為什麼要用，好處在哪 大二下的 C++ 寫的 ncurses 反而感覺像是造成我更多的麻煩 xD 因為我並不知道如果不用 ncurses ，要做同樣的事會多麻煩 所以試試看讓學員真的做一次很麻煩的處理 透過痛過，來知道為什麼要使用工具 Exercise5 深入淺出 Python 排序 (ex5.md) Q1: Python 的 some_list.sort() 跟 sorted(some_list) 差別在哪 Q2: Python 的 sorted() 是用哪種排序演算法 ? 這兩個問題其實並不困難 第一個問題是我以前寫 Python 常遇到的錯誤 同時也想讓大家去想想「如果有不同的做法都能解決問題，他們不同的地方在哪」 第二個問題則是想激起大家的好奇心，試著去探究看似理所當然的東西 最後 Exercise 4, 5 我幾乎直接把答案都公佈了 即使是在這之後才用我公布的方法，我也是會計分 因為這個思考的過程才是重要的，答案一點也不重要 Exercise6 用 Python 做排序 我給了一筆 PTT 爬下來的資料，根據某個 key 做排序 早上才從八卦版剛爬下來的（好像有爬到一些奇怪的東西 ...） 靈感就只是前一天跟學員聊天，聊到他們的視覺化作業要用 PTT 的資料 這個練習目的在於用實際的資料 讓大家感受到程式是真的能解決實際的問題 而且並不如想像中的那麼困難 回想我大一不斷的學習用好的架構寫一個 BMI 的程式 總覺得要寫一個稍微有用的程式是非常非常遙遠的事 所以大二下的 C++ ，對我來我說是寫程式很大的里程碑 這題的解答也是差不多一行而已 data = sorted ( ptt_data , key = lambda x : x [ 'some_key' ]) 但我認為這對新手來說，已經會是相對挑戰的練習了 至少以初學的我來說，我可能就要花不少時間去 survey 、去思考 這個練習中，我還埋了一個坑是「key 可能是空的」 我前一天設計這個練習的時候也入坑了，此坑不能只有我入 我也會下去跟大家討論要怎麼解決這個問題 這個問題本身有很多種不同的解法 我自己的解法是使用 filter 過濾掉空值 但我也遇到學員們有很多不一樣的想法，我覺得挺好的 Bouns Bonus 3 實作各種 sort 作法 Bouns 4 分析各種 sort 適合的情境 因為課程的速度放慢，有些學過的就會覺得比較無聊 這兩個 Bouns 就是設計給這樣的人 至少在這的兩個小時不要是浪費時間 Bouns 4 我也沒有正確解答 我蠻好奇會不會有人能給我一點想法的 不過這麼機車的題目最後看來是沒人寫 xD 「資料結構」練習後記 後來有一次跟學員聊天的時候 學員跟我分享他覺得這樣的練習設計，帶著大家思考很有幫助 看來前一天沒什麼睡到是值得的 3. 「網頁開發、資料庫、雲端運算」第三天後半課程 Slide: CRUD in Flask Sample Code: web-acccounting-example 前面的課程中有由博安老師指導的 Database 跟 Flask Introduction （博安老師的課程可是在 Web 課程中唯一零負評的，真不愧是博安老師！） 而我的內容則會注重在 view 的撰寫上 我先讓大家對要做的東西有概念 (i.e., 記帳程式 ) 在寫程式前，我帶著大家看市面上做出來的記帳程式是長怎樣的？ 這些記帳程式有什麼功能？ 如果用我們這幾天教的想法，我們要怎麼去思考這個後端的系統？ 接著才真正要進入程式 我基於博安老師前一個半小時的程式碼在做延伸 從最原始的 0.1 版 每次只做一點點的修改，每一個修改都給那個 commit 一個 tag 在 slide 的右下角，也會放目前到哪個版本 也希望能從這樣的做法，帶到 frequent commit 的重要 講解程式碼之前 我會先讓大家打過程式碼，並確認可以執行 再來才會解釋每一行程式碼在做什麼 但它們組合起來不見得是對的 xD 尤其剛開始講 view 的 0.2 版更是幾乎沒一個功能是對的 但程式是能跑的 除了聽跟照著做以外 希望能讓大家去發現哪裡有奇怪的地方 試著去想想要怎麼解決這些奇怪的地方 直到 1.0 版才看起來像是一個可以動的網站 但就算到這裡，還是有一個小錯 xD 我想從這裡帶出測試的重要性 統整一下，我整個課程設計想帶給學員的思考 如何思考一個後端架構 ? → 其他人的記帳程式 溝通在寫程式是很重要的 → README.md , requriements.txt 如何除錯？ → 滿是錯誤的 view, postman 的使用 為什麼測試是重要的？ → 整個網站雛形都出來了，還有埋錯 整個構想聽起來是很美好 但這次的嘗試，得到的評價不是很好 其中一份回饋告訴我 「他不太喜歡這樣先複製程式碼在學習如何修改的教學方式 因為一開始看不懂程式碼，只能照著我說的改，會很不知道自己在改什麼」 很感謝願意給我建設性回饋的學員 我也在思考 到底是這樣的方式不適合初學者？ 還是我沒有把這樣的內容表達好？ 如果還有下次的機會 除了思考課程的內容外，我還要多花點時間準備在台上的表達","tags":"Gossiping","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/gossiping/2018/09/X-Village-Course-Design","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/gossiping/2018/09/X-Village-Course-Design"},{"title":"從 Andromoney 到 MOZE","text":"最近不小心被 MOZE 的介面燒到 一個衝動就從 AndroMoney 轉到 MOZE 這篇算是來記錄從 AndroMoney 把資料轉換到 MOZE 的過程 一些無關本文的前言 雖然 X-Village 暫時告一個段落，好像應該來寫個什麼 但真的要寫起來還要再花一點時間 上次 Blog 發文都已經是一年前的事了 但點閱率竟然有一點在上升（雖然還是很低 QAQ） 還有一些人看了我在 Logdown 的 LineBot 文跑來找我討論 覺得蠻開心的 xD 但這邊還是一直都沒辦法被找到 QQ 以後考慮同步發到 Medium 好了 不過好像該進入本文了 xD 為什麼換到 MOZE 當初在 Android 上使用 AndroMoney 就只是因為他免費，而且還算是好用 剛好換到 iOS 的時候，這款 app 也在 App Store 有上架 懶得轉換資料的情況下就繼續買了 用下來覺得 AndroMoney 好像還是在 Android 上比較好用 AndroMoney 的各種功能都很方便，只是介面上就比較普通 xD 而且 AndroMoney 各個平台都有，就算哪天想換 Android 的手機也不怕轉換問題 但是啊， MOZE 的介面就是好看 xD 再來就要說說其他我喜歡 MOZE 的原因 AndroMoney 沒有 (或我不會用) 的功能 借款事件 MOZE 會幫我記住我借錢給誰，而且會一直提醒我誰跟我借了錢 以前都還要特地記錄到其他 app 而且借出的錢，不會算在我的支出，所以也不會影響到我的預算 算是蠻方便的功能 繳費事件 提醒我信用卡要繳費的時間 也會有跟借款事件差不多的提醒 動態改變每天剩餘的預算 這是一個我還蠻需要的功能 我會想知道前幾天花的錢如何影響我這個月剩下的日子的預算 而不是一個從月初的預算直接除以 30 都不改變的數字 帳戶 icon 每個帳戶都能加入自己的 icon 只要是付費版的 MOZE 就會有各家銀行的 icon 雖然他說是付費圖示，但其實這幾個是免費的 只有其他類別的彩色圖是要購買 但我是覺得原本的我比較喜歡 xD 另外，也可以自己製作想要的 icon 匯入 ~ 電子發票載具 以前都沒有什麼要用電子載具的誘因 就完全忘了這回事 現在這個可以直接幫我記帳就很吸引我 而且他也有支援 wideget ，給店家掃過後，馬上就能用 Apple Pay 另外，我原本以為從雲端載下消費紀錄，一定會要再創一個紀錄 但其實這是可以連結到某一筆過去的紀錄 這對我也是蠻重要的功能 只是目前好像還不能針對轉帳或借款事件歸帳 希望這些能透過 MOZE 3.0 會有的分帳功能解決 拆帳 (MOZE 3.0 才有) 雖然目前還沒有，但這個功能我現在很期待 所以還是想列一下 xD MOZE 沒有 (或我不會用) 的功能 專案不能跨幣別 我之前去歐洲的那些紀錄就因為這樣，必須用標籤來分類 QQ 不過聽說 MOZE 3.0 會新增就是 不能將單一紀錄不計算在花費中 主要是有些特別的花費我不會想要扣在我的預算中 這樣那個月剩下的天數的預算就都會是 0，好像也不太對 ... 【AndroMoney 功能教學目錄】 這個我真的覺得超棒的 他把目前能用他現有功能做到的事，全部整理起來 現在 MOZE 還是比較需要去爬舊文翻，或直接問粉專 但不得不說 MOZE 回復速度真的超快 AndroMoney to MOZE transformater 身為一個攻城獅，當然還是要寫自動化的程式來幫我轉換資料格式 手動要處理 5、6000 筆帳務紀錄有點太累了 btw MOZE 有說之後會提供 web 版的匯入工具 在 MOZE 首頁 FAQ 可以找到要如何匯入資料 ( MOZE 格式 ) 基本上就是照著他的格式就能轉換大部分的資料 當然我也寫了一個小 script AndroMoney_to_MOZE_transformater Script 使用方式 python transformater.py --input_file \"Your input filename\" extract 在轉換的過程中，會有一些資料還是要手動輸入的 其實後來大多時間是花在這 ... 會抓出的資料有 帳戶（以及其起始金額） 專案 主類別、次類別 後來發現還有另一個問題是不同幣別的轉帳， AndroMoney 匯出的資料不會有轉入的金額 所以沒辦法自動化，這點倒是比較麻煩 python transformater.py transformat --input_file \"Your input filename\" --output_file MOZE.csv 再來就是要把原本 AndroMoney 的紀錄轉成 MOZE 的格式 只要把這個 MOZE.csv (一定要是這個檔名) 丟到 Dropbox 的 應用程式/MOZE MOZE 就能找到，並能選擇匯入 踩到的一些坑 寫這個 script 的過程中，其實踩到蠻多坑的 匯入了好幾次才成功 一來這是我第一次從 argparse 換到 click 原本想說 argparse 已經算是蠻好用的了 click 真的又更直覺了一點，難怪這麼多人推薦 第一個遇到的問題就是轉帳的「相關行數」 一開始不知道這個行數是從多少開始 以寫程式來說，我就直接去抓那個 row 的 index 所以抓到的 index 是 0-based 後來想到可以試試看 1-based，還是無法匯入成功 最後才發現還要把標頭也考慮進去 第一個 row 其實 index 是 2 第二個問題是轉帳的類別 文件其實只說不用「子類別」，沒說「主類別」要怎麼處理 xD 我試了各種可能的類別後 自己去匯出了一筆轉帳紀錄，才解決 原來轉帳的主類別分別會是「轉入」跟「轉出」 後來弄完後有再去看一下文件，才發現下面其實有寫 ...... 這些問題我都跟作者反應了，他都超快就回了 他是說之後會透過 web 版的工具匯入 Future Improvement 其實我還是蠻喜歡 AndroMoney 的 所以也許會找個時間寫怎麼把 MOZE 轉回 AndroMoney 的功能會寫個 MOZE to AndroMoney 避免我哪天又想回到 Android 了 xD","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/09/from-andromoney-to-moze","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2018/09/from-andromoney-to-moze"},{"title":"GitHub Resume","text":"最近發現了這個可以自動從自己的 Github 上產生履歷的東西 GitHub Résumé 實在有點有趣，就來玩了一下 只要在 repo 上按了 star，你就可以透過 他的頁面 產生你的 GitHub 履歷 基本上就是各種以往的專案和貢獻的統整 我的 GitHub 履歷 果然我光 Python 跟 Jupyter Notebook 加起來就六成了 XD","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/08/GitHub-Resume","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/08/GitHub-Resume"},{"title":"Practical Vim","text":"每天一回一回的看，終於把 Practical Vim 看完了 不過到了後期，大部分就真的都看不太懂了＝ ＝ 所以大多還是只記錄了前期我比較看得懂的一些 tip Ch1: The Vim Way Tip2: Don't Repeat Yourself . command: Repeat the last change Command in normal mode The insert mode between two normal mode Repeatable action and how to repeat them Intent Act Repeat Reverse Make a change . u Scan line for next character f ; , Scan line for previous character F ; , Scan document for next match /pattern <CR> n N Scan document for previous match ?pattern <CR> n N Perform substitution :s/target/replacement & u Execute a sequence of changes qx @x u Ch2: Normal Mode Tip10: Use Counts to Do Simple Arithmetic <C-a> : Add number <C-x> : Sub number What if the cursor is not on a number?

Use Twitter to predict MBIT personality. Problem of Past Researches Language on social media has richer content that makes the typical linguistic analysis tool perform poorly (e.g. iono → I don't know) Gain personality information is costly (e.g. Big Five Questionnaire) MBTI Instead of commonly used big five theory, MBTI is used in this paper. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator There are 4 types of personality trait i.e. Introversion(I) / Extraversion(E) Intuition(N) / Sensing(S) Feeling(F) / Thinking(T) Perception(P) / Judging(J) Personality can be expressed as a code with 4 letters. e.g. ENFJ, INTP Data A Twitter dataset Around 90,000 users 120,000 personality-related tweets from 2006~2015 (out of 1.7 M tweets) What is the so-called personliaty-related tweets? English Tweets that contain users' own MBIT code. e.g. \"I'm an ENFJ\" is qualified \"My friend is an ISFJ\" is not qualified Heuristic rules is used (e.g. \"I'm\" , \"I got\" , \"I have been a\" ) No classification method is used for ensuring the personality code is indeed the user's Distribution Personality distribution of this data is skewed. However, in the real word, the personality distribution might also be skewed. Features 1. n-grams Most frequent 1,000 unigram, bigram, trigram words and phrases 1,000 dimensions vectors for unigram, bigram trigram for each user 2. Twitter Part-of-speech tags Based on Part-of-Speech Tagging for Twitter: Annotation, Features, and Experiments 25 types with some Twitter-specific tag. e.g. hashtag at-mention URL emoticon 3.word vectors Word Vector Settings 2,334,564 words 500 dimension Extracted Features Average word vectors Weighted average word vectors (weighted according to TF-IDF) Prediction Logistic Regression is used (Random Forest and SVM produced similar results) Accuracy Measurement Since the data is skewed, AUC is used. Accuracy Indivisula Features Word Vector Only → (AUC=0.651) n-gram only → (AUC=0.607) POS only → (AUC=0.585) Combinded Features All three features → (AUC=0.661) POS + n-gram → (AUC=0.616) Insight Among the results, word vector performs best which might illustrate that predictions based on social media and language would work. During the POS conversion process, information is compressed into 25 tags and might lost some important one. This might be the reason why it performs worse.","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/04/Understanding-Personality-through-Social-Media","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/04/Understanding-Personality-through-Social-Media"},{"title":"[Paper] Toward Personality Insights from Language Exploration in Social Media","text":"Paper Demo My Slide The main purpose of this paper is to show how social media can be used to gain psychological insights.

Bot ( token = 'Your API Token' ) def _set_webhook (): status = bot . set_webhook ( 'https://Your URL/hook' ) if not status : print ( 'Webhook setup failed' ) sys . exit ( 1 ) @app.route ( '/hook' , methods = [ 'POST' ]) def webhook_handler (): if request . method == \"POST\" : update = telegram . Update . de_json ( request . get_json ( force = True ), bot ) text = update . message . text update . message . reply_text ( text ) return 'ok' if __name__ == \"__main__\" : _set_webhook () app . run () Setup 其中有兩個地方，必須要改成自己的設定 1. API Token bot = telegram . Bot ( token = 'Your API Token' ) Your API Token 要改成剛剛取得的 API Token 2. Webhook URL _set_webhook 中的 Your URL statue = bot . set_webhook ( 'https://Your URL/hook' ) 這裡的 URL 就是設定成你這個 Bot Server 的 URL 不過 Telegram 一樣要求必須要是 https 最簡單的方式就是使用 ngrok (ngrok 的使用在 [Bot] Line Echo Bot on Django 最後面有介紹 ) 平常測試使用 ngrok 就很足夠了 之後要 production 的時候，在 deploy 到適當的 server 就好了 _set_webhook Telegram 有兩種接收訊息的方式 隨時去監聽的 webhook，和主動去要求更新的 get_updates 這裡使用的是 webhook 這個 function 先設定 Bot 的 webhook URL，如果設定失敗就直接終止程式 也就是告訴 Telegram 要把 Bot 收到的訊息傳到哪 而 set_webhook 前面要有個 _的原因是我不希望它被其他的 code 使用 但 Python 本身並不支援 Private 的概念，而是慣例上在前面加一個底線 def _set_webhook (): status = bot . set_webhook ( 'https://Your URL/hook' ) if not status : print ( 'Webhook setup failed' ) sys . exit ( 1 ) 在最後 run Flask app 前，要先把 webhook URL 設定好 if __name__ == \"__main__\" : _set_webhook () app . run () wehook_handler 這裡就是 bot 收到訊息要怎麼處理 @app.route ( '/hook' , methods = [ 'POST' ]) def webhook_handler (): if request . method == \"POST\" : update = telegram . Update . de_json ( request . get_json ( force = True ), bot ) text = update . message . text update . message . reply_text ( text ) return 'ok' app.route 這個 decorator 是 Flask 的語法 表示 https:/Your URL/hook 會導到這個 function，而它只能接受 POST 這裡設定的 /hook 也就是為什麼在 _set_webhook 中的 URL 最後面必須有 /hook 另外還可以發現 webhook_handler 是不帶任何參數的 跟 django 不同的是 Flask 把 request 這種幾乎所有 view function 都會用到的參數直接變成全域可讀取的變數 也就是最一開始的 from flask import Flask , request 接下來 webhook_handler 內做的就只是把收到的訊息轉成 update 再從裡面讀到對方傳來的 text 最後用 reply_text 回傳同樣的 text 回去 這是最簡單的 Telegram Bot 不過我覺得開始學一個東西，還是會希望能在最短時間看到點東西，再慢慢專研 接下來可以從 python-telegram-bot 的 wiki ，試更多 Telegram Bot 的功能 Reference Simple-Echo-Telegram-Bot 開發 Telegram Bot 簡介","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/03/create-a-telegram-echobot","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/03/create-a-telegram-echobot"},{"title":"[Book] 做工的人","text":"「做工的人」由一個個藍領階級的故事所組成 說的是那些壓迫、歧視和無奈 看這本書是會讓人感到很難過的 處於同溫層 常會覺得世界就只是我們看到的樣子 但世界並不是單一面貌的 每個人所看到的、所感受到的世界都是不同的 而「做工的人」帶我們用不同的角度來看他們所看到的世界究竟是如何的 不同於以往這書摘 這篇會多了一點我自己的想法 同樣的，這也不過是這世界上一個微不足道的人的想法罷了 摘錄 我想如果只看這些摘錄文字，應該會不知道在說什麼 XD 不過它們都代表著每一個故事的一小部分 也是在故事中，讓我有感觸的部分 記錄下它們，是為了提醒我不要忘了現在看完這本書的感受 推薦序 - 如果在工地，一個年輕作家的養成 他看見，年輕不羈的工人願意將寶特瓶壓扁資源回收，是為了讓附近的低收入戶可以拿去賣錢。 學有專精的電焊師傅，在得知外勞的悲慘待遇後，會願意將一身技藝傾囊相授，好讓弱者掙脫被壓榨的命運。 阿忠之死 晚上，阿忠的嫂嫂說阿忠的喪事已經辦好了，打來是為了要告訴我：「阿忠對於自己沒能還你那五千元，很對不起。」 生命是有層次的，一層一層剝開後，每一片回憶都會讓人流淚。 台灣媳婦 如果我們判斷人的標準，是用刻苦，是用勤奮，是用力爭上游的努力和對於生活的認真，去決定一個人的品格 那我們不可能看不出來她們值得擁有尊敬，我們又怎麼能夠允許這個社會將它們分別列上不同的標籤呢？ 我們既然知道以一個人的經濟條件去判定其社會階級以及地位是錯的，並深惡譴責，那又為什麼不改變對她們的看法呢？ 隔閡 那種講理財和產業動態的書從來就無法引起我的興趣。 曾幾何時，我發現自己在看任何文字或是哥與、電影時，總感覺到一股不舒服感。 這些文字似乎與我有著隔閡。 我想，是那種對於內容的不快感使我感到很大的不舒服。 而我很清楚，這來自於我親身的感受和所在的位置，與那些撰書者或是創作者不同。 愈是和這個世界接觸越深，我就愈明白其中的差異。 也因此，我始終不能接受論述式的教科書、自以為高深莫測的經文，也討厭那些成功者的傳記和論述。 我知道，我這樣是畫地自限，為自己設下了這樣的隔閡。 可是會不會哪天我也和那本商周一樣，只能在自己的世界裡，看著自己所要的內容？ 看板人 這社會要求他人有尊嚴活著的，幾乎都是不需為下一餐煩憂，並且收入穩定的人。 而我不是，我能理解他們只是想活著，卑微和努力的活著。 對於那些喊著尊嚴的人，因為那傷痕我無言以對。 摘錄以外 在翻開這本書之前 我有看到一篇關於它的文章 下面得回覆就有站在不同立場的師傅的評論 說它美化了很多不應該存在的錯誤 並不是每個師傅都會犯這樣的錯，而那些錯並不是這麼的美麗 但翻完「做工的人」後 我覺得其實作者並沒有說那些事是對的 只是敘述了這樣的事情確實存在著，而它們為什麼存在 「做工的人」不會是這世界的全貌 也不見得能代表整個藍領階級的故事 就像前面也提到有不同立場的師傅提出他們的看法 但我覺得它已經足夠讓我們重新去思考 那些認為是理所當然的事，並不是那麼理所當然 自以為是的正義，不見得就是正義 而我們又是多麼習慣於帶著有色的眼鏡，去看、去批評、去攻擊與我們不同的人們 我很喜歡張獻忠先生在 TEDx Tainan 2016 說的話 如果今天換作是我們遇到同樣的處境 我們真的能處理得更好嗎？ 也許在下次評斷一件事前，去想想這樣的問題，能看到更多 這樣的同理並不是、也不會讓對的事情變錯的，或錯的事情就變成對的 而是嘗試去思考，除了對錯以外的事 最後我想分享一段節錄自實驗室學長在上大學部的課時說過的話 回高中聊天的時候，會發現有些在比較後面學校的同學 他們的家境可能並不是那麼好，可能要打工存學費 生存都是件辛苦的事了，很難有餘力在做出太多的改變 而我們是一群夠幸運的人，能順利地唸到成大 所以可以想想，我們是不是能再多做些什麼改變 除了認知到這些幸運不是那麼的理所當然外 我想再補充的是 在想想還能做什麼改變的時候 是不是也能站在那些不那麼幸運的人們的角度，來思考這些改變 讓這些改變，也可以為他們發聲","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2017/03/worker","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2017/03/worker"},{"title":"SITCON 2017","text":"聽說這次 SITCON 一分鐘就賣完了＠＠ 還好我申請了開源貢獻票 xdddd 所以大家快來貢獻開源專案，脫離搶票吧（？？？？？ RO 共筆 R1 共筆 R2 共筆 R3 共筆 這次大概就這兩場比較印象深刻 前端工程的過去、現在與未來 slide 整體算是給完全不懂前端的我，關於前端的知識 overview Present Webpack 未來可能取代 Gulp 與 grunt Babel : 目前最主流的 Javascript Transpiler e.g. 轉換 ES6 → ES5 雖然 ES6 支援模組標準，但瀏覽器尚未有定論，目前前端依然無法支援模組 可以用 webpack 打包來模擬 非同步處理 : ES6 Promise, async/await 第一次做光劍就上手 slide 雖然隔壁兩場，一場在講 Chat Bot，一場在講 AI 我好像應該去聽 但身為星戰迷，實在無法抵抗光劍的誘惑 The force is strong in this session 一把最簡單的光劍大概台幣 1000 可以起來 感覺有時間蠻值得來玩玩的 xD","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/03/sitcon-2017","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2017/03/sitcon-2017"},{"title":"Tool for Checking Python Coding Style","text":"Pylint Setup pip install pylint Usage Generate a code quality report pylint your_code.py Customize your pylint settings Some rules in default settings might be too trivial.

It's Either HELL YEAH! Or No 如果這件事不是「太棒了！我一定要去做！！！」，那麼就不要做了 另外一個更明確的做法是 Rule of Three 在一天結束前，為明天定下三件重要而且一定要完成的事 只要三件， 可以少，但不可以多 ，就算只有一件也很好 只要這三件事情還沒有達成就不能做其他的事 這樣做的好處是可以明確的知道接下來要做什麼，大腦的負擔會比較小 也不會讓自己因為有太多未完成的代辦事項而分心 意志力有限 人的意志力是非常有限的 所以留給一點彈性給自己吧 不要把整天都排滿工作，適時的排給自己一點休閒 人畢竟不是機器，沒辦法不停的工作 尤其到了越晚，意志力會越來越薄弱 所以我會盡量把重要的習慣，擺在早上做完 如果真的累了，就休息吧 不論是體力上的疲憊，或只是意志力的消磨殆盡 死撐著也只是無意義的消磨時間，而且還有可能導致工作出錯 不過休息就真的休息，聽點音樂或什麼的都好 去滑臉書、收信件、看新聞，這些往往會讓意志力恢復得更慢 後記 其實我一直想花時間，紀錄一下服役時間各種嘗試讓自己更有效率的方法 今天終於下定決心好好的寫這篇文章 大三、大四的那兩年，好像常常把自己搞得很忙 雖然不算沒有做到事 但總覺得自己好像有點是在瞎忙 明明花這些時間應該可以做更多的事 服役期間，剛好坐我隔壁的學長很喜歡看書 就漸漸地養成一週至少會看一本書的習慣 上面提到的這些書也都是這段時期看的 後來就漸漸把這些應用在其他我想學想做的事情上 第一次好好上完一個為期三個月的線上課程，其實蠻有成就感的 再來遇到的問題就是，在這之後我排了太多的線上課程和想看的書 有時候白天工作量比較多，回到宿舍還要持續好幾個小時的 work 實在太讓人吃不消 所以我重新檢視了我的計劃和每天要達成的習慣 哪些是真的重要的 這些事又要怎麼拆解才能不會讓我太費力，或只要多花一點力，不會很容易半途而廢的 這些只是我嘗試覺得有用的方法 不見得適用於每個人 不過也許都能去嘗試看看，相信總會有一些有幫助的部分","tags":"Gossiping","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/gossiping/2017/02/how-do-i-manage-my-time","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/gossiping/2017/02/how-do-i-manage-my-time"},{"title":"More than Just Echo Bot","text":"知道怎麼實作一個會 Echo 的 Bot 後 再來就要思考，開發一個 Bot 我們要提供什麼功能 (e.g., 天氣查詢, 訂票, 推薦旅遊景點) 不過這裡要討論的不是 Bot 的功能 Bot 的功能實作，跟一般網站或 App 的實作並沒有太大的差別 接下來來談如何從使用者說的話來判斷，使用者要使用的功能 如果使用者問：「今天天氣如何？」「天氣今天好嗎？」 要如何知道，他都是要詢問今天的天氣狀況 也就是使用者的「意圖」 Based on Keyword 上一篇文章，輸入關鍵字就能回傳 template message 的 bot 也是用這樣的方式實作的 if 'button' in text : # Send ButtonTemplate ...... elif 'confirm' in text : # Send ConfirmTemplate ...... elif 'carousel' in text : # Send CarouselTemplate ...... else : # Echo TextMessage ...... 回歸到天氣的問題 可以試著找出「天氣」是否有出現在使用者的問句中 再來判斷「今天」, 「明天」這樣敘述時間的詞 e.g. if '天氣' in text : if '今天' in text : return today_s_weather elif '明天' in text : return tomorrow_s_weather Pros 不需要其他的背景知識，容易實作 運算量小 Cons 建立規則很麻煩 規則很容易就會出現例外，很難定義得完整 只要使用者無法觸發到關鍵字，就無法使用功能 一堆 if else 造成程式冗長，不易擴充和維護 AIML Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language 它是一款基於 XML 的 markup language 這是最基本的 AIML <aiml version= \"1.0.1\" encoding= \"UTF-8\" ? > <category> <pattern> HELLO ALICE </pattern> <template> Hello User! </template> </category> </aiml> 只要符合特定的 pattern，就回傳指定的 template 也能透過 <random> 這樣的 tag，從多種回覆隨機丟一種回傳 <random> <li> response1 </li> <li> response2 </li> ... </random> Pros 比起只用 if else 更結構化，較易維護和擴充 Cons 依然很難包含所有的狀況 Other NLP Service Wit.ai (Facebook) COSCUP 2016 的聊天機器人小啄，就是透過 Wit.ai 實作的 LUIS (Microsoft) API.ai (Google) 這些服務能透過標記和訓練 解析出這句話的每一個片段，所具有的意義 e.g. 「今天西雅圖天氣如何」 時間：今天 地點：西雅圖 意圖：天氣如何 Wit.ai Wit.ai 跟 LUIS, API.ai 比較不同的地方是 從 Wit.ai 得到的是，我們設定的回覆 而不是一句話解析後的結果 LUIS 從 這裡 可以測試兩個訓練過的範例機器人，看看從 LUIS 可以得到什麼 e.g. Question how is the weather in the Taipei Response { \"query\" : \"how is the weather in the Taipei\" , \"topScoringIntent\" : { \"intent\" : \"GetCurrentWeather\" , \"score\" : 0.50119406 , \"actions\" : [ { \"triggered\" : false , \"name\" : \"GetCurrentWeather\" , \"parameters\" : [ { \"name\" : \"location\" , \"required\" : true , \"value\" : null } ] } ] }, \"entities\" : [], \"dialog\" : { \"contextId\" : \"80cd646a-d85d-4b40-873d-1b47fa49adc8\" , \"status\" : \"Question\" , \"prompt\" : \"Where would you like to get the current weather for?\" , \"parameterName\" : \"location\" } } API.ai Question Hey Calendar, schedule lunch with Mary Johnson at 12 pm tomorrow.

file - 如果用其他的部署套件，則需要修改 web 後面的指令 到了這裡就做好所有的設定了 最後只要 git push heroku master 就會部署到 Heroku 上 透過 heroku open 能看到剛剛部署上去的專案 接著把專案的網址加上我們先前設定的 callback url echobot/callback 設定到 Line Bot 的 Webhook URL，就完成了 Reference Getting Started on Heroku with Python Deploying Python and Django Apps on Heroku","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2016/11/deploy-linebot-on-heroku","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2016/11/deploy-linebot-on-heroku"},{"title":"Line Echo Bot on Django","text":"單純要寫一個只會 Echo 的 Line Chat Bot 用 flask 只要 85 行的 code 就能解決 官方已經有提供相當清楚的範例 flask-echo 了 這篇文章則是提供了 django 的做法 想直接看 code 也可以參考 line_echobot Line Messaging API (line-bot-sdk-python) 詳細的 Line Bot 提供哪些功能，該如何使用 可以在 API Reference - Messaging API 找到 之後的文章，會談如何使用文字以外的功能 這裡直接使用官方提供的 line-bot-sdk-python pip3 install line-bot-sdk 另外官方也提供 java , go , php , ruby , perl 的版本 Start Project Create Project # Create a line_echobot project django-admin startproject line_echobot # Create an echobot app python3 manage.py startapp echobot Setup Line Secrets 接著設定 Line Bot 的 Channel Secret , Channel Access Token ( 可以在 Line Bot 的 Line Deverloper 頁面取得 ) 不過這些值不該被 git 記錄，所以不該被寫死在 settings.py 中 建議將這些值寫入環境變數 export SECRET_KEY = 'Your django secret key' export LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'Your line channel access token' export LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET = 'Your line channel secret' 執行時，讓設定檔先去讀取這些環境變數 下面的 get_env_variable 函式是用來取得環境變數 只要有少設定，就會丟出 ImproperlyConfigured 的例外事件中斷執行 # line_echobot/settings.py ...... def get_env_variable ( var_name ): try : return os . environ [ var_name ] except KeyError : error_msg = 'Set the {} environment variable' . format ( var_name ) raise ImproperlyConfigured ( error_msg ) SECRET_KEY = get_env_variable ( 'SECRET_KEY' ) LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN = get_env_variable ( 'LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN' ) LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET = get_env_variable ( 'LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET' ) ...... INSTALLED_APPS = [ ...... , 'echobot' ] 不過如果只是單純測試用，這些值也可以直接寫死在 settings.py 中 另外也不要忘了在 INSTLLED_APPS 加入 echobot 一般來說，django 產生 project 時 settings.py 裡面就會有 secret key 這裡的做法是把預設的 secret key 刪掉 設定到環境變數中，避免被 git 記錄下來 如果還需要另外還要重新產生可以透過 django-secret-keygen.py Setup Line Webhook URL 再來要設定一個 Webhook URL 讓 Line 可以把 Bot 收到的訊息傳給我們 先在 project 的 urls.py 設定 讓 project 可以找到 echobot 這個 app 的 urls.py # line_echobot/urls.py ...... import echobot urlpatterns = [ ...... , url ( r '&#94;echobot/' , include ( 'echobot.urls' )), ] ...... 接著在 echobot 內，創一個 urls.py 並將 url 再導到 callback ，呼叫 views.py 裡面的 callback 函式 ( 接下來才會實作 ) # echobot/urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from . import views urlpatterns = [ url ( '&#94;callback/' , views . callback ), ] 這些都設定完後，要在 Line 那邊設定的 Webhook Url 就是 https://\"your domain name\"/echobot/callback/ ( your domain name 要設定什麼，會在這篇文章的 最後 說明) Implement Callback Funtion 接下來就是要在 echobot/views.py 實作 callback 了 Initial 先 import 相關的函式庫 from django.conf import settings from django.http import HttpResponse , HttpResponseBadRequest , HttpResponseForbidden from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt from linebot import LineBotApi , WebhookParser , WebhookHandler from linebot.exceptions import InvalidSignatureError , LineBotApiError from linebot.models import MessageEvent , TextMessage , TextSendMessage 透過 line_bot_api 傳訊息給 Line，讓 Line 轉傳給使用者 line_bot_api = LineBotApi ( settings . LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN ) Callback Function 有兩種方法可以處理 Line Server 送過來的訊息 這裡先用 Todo 記著，待會再來補上 # TODO: Define Receiver @csrf_exempt def callback ( request ): if request . method == 'POST' : signature = request . META [ 'HTTP_X_LINE_SIGNATURE' ] body = request . body . decode ( 'utf-8' ) # TODO: Handler when receiver Line Message return HttpResponse () else : return HttpResponseBadRequest () Validate Signature 處理訊息之前 先確認這個 request 是不是真的是從 Line Server 傳來的 要確認這件事，需要 request 的 body request header 中的 X-Line-Signature 也就是上面的 signature = request . META [ 'HTTP_X_LINE_SIGNATURE' ] body = request . body . decode ( 'utf-8' ) Handle Recevied Message 取得 body 跟 signature 後 Line Bot API 會在處理訊息的同時，確認這個訊息是否來自 Line 而處理 Line 傳過來給我們的訊息，有兩種不同的做法 WebhookParser WebhookParser 會 Parse 這個訊息的所有欄位 讓我們針對各種不同型別的訊息做個別的處理 e.g. UserID Event Type Message Content and etc. 在 這裡 可以找到有哪些欄位 這段 code 要取代上面的 # TODO: Define Receiver parser = WebhookParser ( settings . LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET ) 下面三段 code 則要取代 # TODO: Handler when receiver Line Message parser 會 parse 所有的 event 跟各個 event 中的所有欄位 如果 request 不是從 Line Server 來的，就會丟出 InvalidSignatureError 其他使用錯誤，或 Line Server 的問題都會是丟出 LineBotApiError try : events = parser . parse ( body , signature ) except InvalidSignatureError : return HttpResponseForbidden () except LineBotApiError : return HttpResponseBadRequest () 再來要判斷收到的事件是什麼事件 這個 Bot 只需要 echo 純文字訊息 所以先判斷這個事件是不是訊息事件，而這個訊息是不是文字訊息 for event in events : if isinstance ( event , MessageEvent ): if isinstance ( event . message , TextMessage ): line_bot_api . reply_message ( event . reply_token , TextSendMessage ( text = event . message . text ) ) 最後的 reply_message 函式，讓我們傳訊息給 Line Server 第一個參數是要回傳要用的 reply_token，可以從事件中取得 （ event.reply_token ） 使用這個 reply_token 做回覆，是不用收費的 不過同一個 reply_token 只能使用一次，而且在一定的時間內就會失效 第二個參數是這次要回傳的訊息 這裡 有所有能回傳的訊息 也可以傳一個都是訊息的 list 或 tuple 不過一次最多只能傳 5 個 只要超過就會有 LineBotApiError WebhookHandler WebhookHandler 是針對每一種不同的訊息型態註冊一個處理器 只要收到這樣的訊息，就會丟給對應的處理器 如果確定每一類訊息，在任何情況下都會有相似的處理方式，就很適合這樣的設計 接下來的三段 code 要取代 # TODO: Define Receiver handler = WebhookHandler ( settings . LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET ) 先為 handler 加入，TextMessage 的處理器 參數是接收到的 event 這裡做的也是讀取到原本 event 中的文字，並回傳回去 @handler.add ( MessageEvent , message = TextMessage ) def handle_text_message ( event ): line_bot_api . reply_message ( event . reply_token , TextSendMessage ( text = event . message . text ) ) 因為沒有要處理其他訊息 如果收到其他訊息 (e.g. 貼圖 , 照片 ) 或訊息以外的事件 使用 default 來回傳 \"Currently Not Support None Text Message\" 的文字訊息 @handler.default () def default ( event ): print ( event ) line_bot_api . reply_message ( event . reply_token , TextSendMessage ( text = 'Currently Not Support None Text Message' ) ) 下面的這段 code 是要取代 # TODO: Handler when receiver Line Message handler 判斷完這個訊息，應該被哪個處理器處理，就會傳給那個函式處理 try : handler . handle ( body , signature ) except InvalidSignatureError : return HttpResponseForbidden () except LineBotApiError : return HttpResponseBadRequest () Full Code 由於上面的 code 說明比較分散 這裡附上兩個版本各自的完整版 WebhookParser # line_echobot/echobot/views.py # WebhookParser version from django.conf import settings from django.http import HttpResponse , HttpResponseBadRequest , HttpResponseForbidden from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt from linebot import LineBotApi , WebhookParser from linebot.exceptions import InvalidSignatureError , LineBotApiError from linebot.models import MessageEvent , TextMessage , TextSendMessage line_bot_api = LineBotApi ( settings .

In addition, multi-source learning (FB and IG) is used to improve performance through STM. SNMDD is a classification model based on TSVM The use of domain knowledge from psychology to extract features is the core of this model. The most interesting part is choosing features as the proxy features to replace ones that are hard to detect. For example, distinguishing whether a social capital is a strong tie or a weak tie is crucial to the detection of SNMD. However, it's hard to detect through OSNs data. Thus, it guesses that friends you interacts (e.g. posts, likes, comments) with might be the strong tie ones.

A B |- - - - - - - - - - -| 對顧客最方便，因為對顧客來說最遠也不過就走 30m 最後的奈許平衡會是 1，即使 2 才是最好的結果 然而當 A 想要設店在離海 30m 的地方的時候 B 就會像把店往左移，如此就能吸引到更大範圍的顧客 實際案例 日本拉麵店都集中在車站 Ch4: 動態賽局 - 時間，可以解決問題 動態賽局並不是一個特定賽局，而是一種統稱 隨著時間經過，賽局發展也會產生變化的結構 擴散型賽局 假設目前城市中已經有一家 A 工廠，B 工廠在考慮是否進入 A 工廠的選項是「戰鬥」和「合作」 B 工廠是「進入」和「不進入」 原本 A 工廠的利益是 3 如果 B 工廠不加入的話，自身利益是 0 如果 B 工廠加入，而 A 工廠選擇合作，則雙方利益為 1 如果 B 工廠加入，A 工廠選擇戰鬥則雙方都是 -1 如果用原本的 2x2 表格來做計算 可以發現奈許均衡在「A 戰鬥 Ｘ B 不進入」「A 合作 X B 進入」 B 進入 B 不進入 A 戰鬥 -1, -1 3, 0 A 合作 1, 1 3, 0 不過「A 戰鬥 X B 不進入」是不會發生的 這時候就可以透過「賽局樹」來觀察時間流 - 戰鬥 → (-1, -1) A 工廠 - 進入 → - 合作 → (1, 1) B 工廠 - 不進入 → (3, 0) 這種賽局要使用反向歸納（backward induction），排除「奇怪的奈許均衡」 如果 B 工廠進入，A 工廠就會合作 則「A 戰鬥 X B 進入」可以被排除 再來 B 工廠去比較「A 合作 X B 不進入」和「B 不進入」 就能消除不進入的選項 時間矛盾的問題 - 空包彈式的威脅 就前面的 A, B 工廠例子來說 A 工廠進入市場前的最佳行動是戰鬥，所以一定會表現出強硬的姿態 然而 B 工廠一旦進入，A 工廠就會為了利益選擇合作 像這樣 A 工廠的強勢姿態就只是「空包彈」 實際案例 不 ... 的話，就會 ...。 然而這樣的情況卻沒發生，久而久之就無效了 解決方案之一 - 創造出必須遵守約定的狀況 製藥特許權制度 製藥需要很大的成本，如果沒給予製藥公司製藥成功有販售的特許權 製藥公司就會不願意投入，最後人民會受害 所以這個特許權必須被法定 高級品決不降價 一旦降價，就會產生「等一段時間，價格會下降」的想法 以後的物品更不可能用原價把商品賣出 「重複賽局」和「扣板機策略」 回到最一開始的囚犯賽局 如果這個賽局會執行不止一次 最終兩人就會選擇都不認罪的最佳利益 這兩人本來就已經知道最好的選擇是都不認罪 但因為無法抹去「如果對方背叛了 ...」的想法，才會不做出最佳選擇 但是如果「對方背叛我，我就讓他好看」的策略成為可能 就會產生某種信賴關係，讓兩人都導向選擇不認罪 將無限重複的賽局視為大型賽局，而會成為奈許均衡的選項，即是採取合作關係 這稱為「無名氏定理」(folk theorem) 就算是在短期關係中極可能背叛對方的狀況 只要關係變成長期的，就有可能表現出能好好維持合作的關係 Ch5: 人為什麼無法理性？ - 情感和賽局理論 所有的賽局都是在一個共通條件上成立的 - 玩家只考慮自己的利益，各自做出符合理性的行動 而這個前提卻是常常不會成立的 人能預測未來嗎？ - 蜈蚣賽局 爸爸手上有 100 枚硬幣，要分配給 A, B 兩個兒子 但必須遵循以下兩個規定 首先，爸爸會在 A 面前放 1 枚 A 可以選擇「停止」或「繼續」 如果選擇「停止」就結束 選擇「繼續」，則爸爸會從 A 那邊拿起 1 枚 ( 即使後期 A 有不止 1 枚，還是只會拿 1 枚 ) 並且再加上手上的 1 枚，2 枚一起給 B 這個狀況用反向歸納預測的結果是「A 在第一回合就應該選擇停止」 如此 A 便能獲得比 B 還多的硬幣 但是在實際實驗中，卻沒有人做出了這樣的決定 人並沒有辦法預測未來 拍賣賽局 - 證明人會從理性到瘋狂 與一般拍賣不同 競標成功後，未得標的前一位出價者，需要付他喊出的價錢 而這個東西依然會給得標者 也就是，前一位出價者付了錢卻什麼都拿不到 這種賽局一直執行下去，玩家就必須一直往高價喊 實際案例 選舉的燒錢比賽 泡沫經濟 「你沒想清楚後果」確實是個問題，但是你還要考慮的是「其他人沒想清楚後果的可能性」 只用金錢，無法驅動人心 利益並非唯一能影響人心的，往往情感也是 最後通牒賽局 A, B 兩位玩家憑空得到 1000 元 由 B 決定分配方式，A 有同意或否決權 A 同意的話則造這個分配方式 A 否決的話就都拿不到錢 只執行一次賽局 如果人是理性的，A 即使只拿到 1 元都應該接受 然而實際上這樣的狀況卻幾乎不會發生 獨裁者賽局 (Dicatator game) 跟上面同樣的情境 只是這次 A 沒有任何決定權，只能接受 B 的分配 此時 B 的最佳選擇就是 1000 元全部拿走 然而實驗結果，相當多的人依然會給對方一定程度的金額","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/10/how-to-think-like-a-game-theorist","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/10/how-to-think-like-a-game-theorist"},{"title":"[Book] 穀倉效應","text":"什麼是穀倉？ 組織內各部門自成一格 後續可能造成，組織內資訊不流通，組織各部門內鬥 然而在現在專業分工的時代，聚集專業人士的穀倉也是必須存在的 這本書用案例說明穀倉會帶來的問題和如何減少那些問題 Outline 第 1 章介紹如何透過人類學的概念來思考 2~4 章是穀倉效應造成問題的案例 第 2 章是 sony 的案例，即使他們已經發現穀倉的問題，卻也還是無法解決 5~7 章則是打破穀倉的實際案例 第 6 章是 Facebook 的案例 第 7 章是克理夫蘭臨床醫學中心 第 8 章則是在穀倉造成問題及打破穀倉各提一些 如果要快速看過，建議順序是 前言 → ( 第 1 章，可看可不看 ) → 2~4 選一章 → 5~7 選一章 → 結語 前言：彭博市府的機密任務 廢油處理問題 （跨部門的合作） 餐廳多半趁深夜偷偷倒油，數年來讓當局一直束手無策。 弗勞爾斯小組從環保部取得廢油污染的資料，跟餐廳執照、退稅紀錄與廚房火警等不同資料互相比對。 他們標定並未申請廢油處理的餐廳，列出可能偷倒廢油的餐廳名單。 然後到市府另一個負責廣生柴油的部門，詢問部門人員時否願意跟食安稽查員與消防單位合作， 說服餐廳不再偷倒廢油，而是把廢油賣給回收單位。 福勞爾斯說：「現在稽查員發現餐廳偷倒廢油時，不會只是走上前說：『喂，搞什麼鬼啊！罰緩二萬五千美元！』 他們改成說：『別傻了，拿這些來換錢吧！賣給生質柴油公司吧！外頭一大堆公司巴不得要購買這些廢油呢！』」 Ch1 - 局外人：從人類學照見穀倉 環境裡的習性不僅反映我們頭腦裡的心理地圖與分類系統，還會加以強化 由於菁英階級樂於維持現狀，他們會設法強化既有的文化、規則與分類方式 沈默具有意義，特定議題遭到忽略，是因為大家早已經把這些議題視為無趣、禁忌、平淡或無禮 Ch2 - 章魚甕：穀倉如何拖累革新 儘管專業化穀倉讓公司顯得更有效率，至少短期如此，但有利也有弊 管理階層發現要自負盈虧，他們開始試著「保護」自己的部分 不只對抗公司外的競爭對手，也對抗公司裡的其他部門 不願彼此分享點子 優秀人員不在跨部門輪調，合作程度降低 連創新實驗與長期投資也逐漸減少，大家短視近利，不願承受風險。 Satya Nadella 說：「一但你太過依賴過往的成功，就容易不願互相合作 ... 但外頭競爭對手才不管你們內部有什麼問題」 Ch4 - 俄羅斯娃娃：穀倉如何造成狹隘視野 決策者看不見危機的最大原因在於整個系統過度分工 e.g. 總體經濟研究者關注經濟數字，卻忽略金融系統的細微變化 銀行監管機關監督個別銀行，卻忽略其他金融機構 有些民營銀行相當了解影子銀行，但沒有跟中央銀行人員交流 Ch6 - 改寫社會規則：打開穀倉大門 每一個進入臉書的員工都必須參加新兵訓練營，在不同部門論調，藉此了解整間公司，透過這個想達到是的是兩件事 人員分為不同的專案團隊，各自專門負責特定任務 編寫程式需要針對特定專案進行密切的團隊合作 穀倉是臉書這類的公司的必要之惡 如果沒有專業部門和團隊，根本無法完成工作，也難以集中火力與區分權責 讓不同專案團隊的成員之間斯底亞有第二套人際關係，不受正式的部分區分所限 藉此避免專案團隊變得僵化與封閉，讓人員不只對所屬團隊有感情，也對整個公司有向心力 Ch7 - 取下鏡片：醫生如何避免經濟專家的錯誤 透過建築空間來鼓勵人員打破穀倉 Facebook 的 Hacker 廣場 克理夫蘭臨床醫學中心的空橋 李透說：「長年傳統與慣例只在不得不時才會改變。哈佛不必改變，哈佛就是哈佛，具有悠久歷史，還是世上募款能力最強的名校。但我們（克理夫蘭臨床醫學中心）試衣間不太賺錢的醫院，位於人口逐漸減少的夕陽工業成，不得不做得更好，並發揮創意。」 結語 像人類學家一樣看世界，換你主宰穀倉 世界上穀倉造成的問題 官僚部門之間缺乏溝通 公司內部團隊明爭暗鬥，把資訊扣在自己手上 破除穀倉的啟示 大型組織不仿讓團隊界線保持彈性 讓不同部門一起激盪與合作 透過空間設計讓人員不期而遇 組織必須反思薪資與獎勵，當人員報酬完全取決於團隊表現，不同團隊容易彼此內鬥 資訊流通的重要 跳脫一般想像的分類方式 多數人幾乎始終把既有的分類、制度視為理所當然","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/10/the-silo-effect","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/10/the-silo-effect"},{"title":"COSCUP 2016 小啄如何實作的","text":"今年 COSCUP 的聊天機器人「小啄」 終於在今天宣告退休了 退休前他讓我們詢問了「你是如何實作的」 這邊是我測試的所有結果 跟大家分享一下 XD 總結 技術相關 主要用 Python 開發 使用 Flask + Gunicorn + Nginx，達到系統輕量化與多執行緒 用 redis 作為文本儲存，SQL Injection 無效 後台文本管理使用 google sheet 使用 Python 的 gspred 文案編輯完後，對 bot 下同步指令，將 google sheet 資料更新到後端資料庫 跟吃飯喝水一樣簡單，連麻瓜劇本管理員都會用（？？？？？？） 使用 wit.ai （這是我直接問開發者的，不是小啄回答的） 小啄回覆的原文 小啄的後台文本管理使用 google sheet，透過 Python 的 gspread 套件進行溝通；當文案編輯完畢後，對 bot 下同步指令，後端就會透過 gspread 將 google sheet 的資料同步到後端資料庫唷 小啄的後台文本管理使用 google sheet，python 有個套件叫 gspread，讓你存取 google sheet 跟吃飯喝水一樣簡單！ 小啄的後台文本管理使用 google sheet，python 有個套件叫 gspread，讓你存取 google sheet 跟吃飯喝水一樣簡單！ 真的超簡單的，連麻瓜劇本管理員都會用！（麻瓜忍不住一定要再說一次） 小啄使用的佈署環境是 Flask + Gunicorn + Nginx 的組合，藉此達成系統輕量化與多執行緒的接收訊息。 小啄使用 redis 作為文本儲存系統，因此不要再試著 SQL Injection 喇，這是沒用的!!!

Ch4 策略的試金石 個人的誘因跟公司長遠目標衝突，是常見的現象 e.g. 立委任期為四年 一個好的國家計劃要五年十年 然而要讓自己繼續連任，只有提出短期能有成效的計劃才能達到讓自己連任的目標 要同時顧及個人及團體，是非常不容易的 Part 2 圓滿的人際關係 在做資源分配時，你必須注意是否與心中的優先順序相符 對你來說，什麼是成功 ? 什麼是不重要的 ? 沒有結果並非代表你失敗了，只能證明你用的方法還不對 Ch5 時鐘滴答響 在所有成功的公司當中，有 93% 都必須改變最初的策略 所以 不一定要訂定一個固定的生涯目標，而是隨著自己不斷的成長而一直改變 稍微想想，就會發現在忙碌時我們疏忽了哪些人 你或許覺得家人很愛你，你和朋友友誼深厚，他們不會在乎被疏忽 其實不然 長久不花時間、精力去培養人際關係，身邊的人最後還是會離你而去 Ch6 一杯奶昔的任務 每一個成功的產品或服務之所以能大受歡迎，是因為這種東西 幫我們完成了不得不做的工作 如果一個人開發出一種有趣的產品，但沒能幫上消費者的忙，這種東西就難以成功 我們可以為伴侶做任何事情，但是如果做得並不是她最需要的，就會面對挫折與困惑 即使我們用心良善，也有深切的愛，還是常常誤解彼此需要的 請問自己「另一半需要我做甚麼 ?」 Ch7 席瑟司之船 別把未來外包 你得了解未來要成功必須具備的能力，無論如何都別把這樣的能力外包了，否則就是把未來交給別人 e.g., DELL 逐步將個人電腦的技術包給華碩，最後華碩自創品牌，DELL 就不再具有優勢了 「我父母給我最好的禮物並非他們為我做了甚麼，而是他們沒為我做的」 Ch8 經驗學校 很有趣的統計，企業主管認為自己所用非人約有 25% 換言之，主管時常用錯人 他們在產品製造或服務上追求零瑕疵 但在挑選人才時，出錯機率卻高達 25% 然而他們卻認為這樣的錯誤率是可接受的 Ch9 一隻看不見的手 在孩子還小，尚未面臨困難的選擇時，就必須培養他們心中設定優先順序的能力 長大以後，他們才知道如何評估各種選擇，做出最好的決定 企業文化 文化不是管理階級花時間和員工溝通、講述就可以形成的，當然也不是寫寫標語就好了 文化會建立在員工做的一連串決定上 每次碰到問題或挑戰時，如何去解決他的決定 例如 :「新產品是不是品質尚可就達到出貨標準了 ?」 如果面對這樣的問題，負責的人討論後決定只要品質尚可就能出貨 下一次員工面臨類似問題的時候就會做出同樣的決定 碰到問題時，不只是解決就好了，還必須從解決的過程了解什麼是最重要的 同樣的道理，如果你希望家人都能在家庭文化的影響下 依循依定的優先順序做事，這樣的優先順序則必須跟文化相符合 例如你希望家裡有和善的文化，那麼在孩子第一次碰到跟和善相關的選擇，你就得幫他做決定 若孩子沒這麼做，你就得針對這件事指導孩子，並解釋為什麼他們該採取和善的做法 Ch10 就這麼一次 ... 百分之百的堅持比百分之九十八來得容易 有很多人都相信自己真的只是一次妥協，下不為例 如果是小小的選擇，我們都有很好的理由 這些選擇往往不是攸關一生的重大決定。乍看之下邊計成本都很低 然而一個又一個決定累積下來，你就會慢慢走上不歸路，變成不一樣的人 百分之百堅守原則，比百分之九十八來得容易 如果你不越界，個人道德界限的力量就會很強大 要是你用好理由說服自己，那就成了一個沒有原則的人，甚麼事都做得出來 為了變成自己理想中的，每一個人的過程都不同。不管如何，你應該要能回答這樣的問題 :「我真的想要變成那樣的人嗎 ?」 「如果我將每日禱告、反思的時間拿來研究迴歸分析，我將後悔莫及。 每年，我用到計量經濟學工具不過只有幾次，而我對人生目的的認知卻天天都可派上用場」","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/08/how-will-you-measure-your-life","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/08/how-will-you-measure-your-life"},{"title":"[Paper] A Learning-based Framework to Handle Multi-round Multi-party Influence Maximization on Social Networks","text":"Paper 1.

錢都花到哪去了？ 遠視：太過擔心未來，而損及眼前的生活。 這樣的吝嗇心態會讓人花更多時間、與朋友疏離、讓家人抓狂也讓自己痛苦 Ch6 - 意志力可以鍛鍊嗎 「讓你的大腦習慣訂定小目標，並加以達成，能幫助你做到原本做不到的大事情」 不光為了練習特定的技能，還要把困難度加高，決不寬貸，如此一來，你才會行有餘力，超過原本設定的目標。對我來說，這就是紀律。全靠不斷重複和練習而來」 練習控制情緒並不能強化意志力。意志力也無法用來控制情緒 控制情緒一般得靠其他技巧，像是改變對眼前問題的看法，或者讓自己分心 試著改變一些習慣性的動作（e.g. 坐姿坐正、右撇子用左手寫字），都是自我控制的練習 Ch8 - 戒癮的真相 對許多人來說，停下來喝一杯也許無傷大雅，之後好幾個月也不會酗酒 可是如果是無法控制喝酒的人，就不能把偶爾一次喝酒當成獨立事件 最好的方法，就是離酒吧遠一點 明確界線 如果你只承諾自己「適量」，這並不是明確界線。模糊的界線會漸漸讓你沒發現自己已經失控 零容忍才是明確界線 Ch10 - 節食風暴 What-the-hell Effect e.g., 節食者已經定下每日最高卡路里攝取量，當他們因為某種原因而吃進超標的熱量時，例如實驗喝下兩大杯奶昔，他們便認為當日的節食努力告吹。這時候就會放縱自己去享受，甚至讓自己吃比原本超標的量還多得多的食物 延遲享樂 vs 不 告訴自己「我待會再吃」對大腦的作用等同於「現在就吃」 拒絕甜點需要意志力 對於大腦來說，等一下顯然比永遠不來得輕鬆一點 時間拉長，你的慾望降低，吃進的食物也變少 結語 - 你可以更有意志力，只要你不拖延 減輕生活壓力的最佳方式就是停止搞砸生活 你得好好規劃人生 自制力強的人花在拒絕慾望的時間少於其他人 他們不會把意志力當成經常性策略 他們妥善安排生活，所以能避免麻煩，避免生活出現需要意志力的事件 他們用意志力來避免危機，而不是度過危機 早在汽車故障錢就送車去保養，並遠離吃到飽的自助餐 意志力的運用過程比結果重要 如果你企圖抗拒誘惑、最後屈服，因為你曾經掙扎過，還是會耗損意志力，屈服並不會補充意志力 你必須隨時維持至少五年的籠統願景，然後訂出較具體的立即目標 要知道你在當月要完成什麼，以及如何做到 預留一些彈性，也要做好失敗的心理準備 月底檢討時，要記得你 不需要每一次都達成目標 更重要的是，你的人生逐月進步 「在管理上，我們要求公司主管和其他員工訂出每週的優先目標，目標不能超過三個，小於三個也沒關係。我們每週逐一檢討上週的成果。如果三個目標中，你只完成一個或兩個，無妨，但在前三個目標未完成前，你不能進行其他目標，就這樣，這就是我們的管理方式。它很簡單，但能強迫你先處理最優先的事情，而且嚴格執行」 正向拖延的力量 等一下再享受 把惡習拖延，最後可能就不會去做 保存意志力的持久技巧：習慣","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/06/willpower","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/06/willpower"},{"title":"解決更新 gcc 找不到 libgfortran.3.dylib (Octave,R)","text":"最近在 mac 上更新了 gcc 6 後，不管是開 Octave 還是 R 都會出現以下的錯誤訊息 dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/gcc/5/libgfortran.3.dylib Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/r/3.3.0/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libR.dylib Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 這是因為原本的 lib 會去找 /usr/local/lib/gcc/5/ 下的 lib 但是更新過後已經被變成 /usr/local/lib/gcc/6/ 了 所以只要從 /usr/local/lib/gcc/5/ 建立 soft link 到 /usr/local/lib/gcc/6/ 即可 ( 版本號則要根據自身 gcc 的版本來做修改 ) ln -s /usr/local/lib/gcc/5/ /usr/local/lib/gcc/6/ Reference R and julia won't start after upgrade (perhaps gcc 5.1, Xcode 6.3.2, or Command Line Tools 6.3)","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2016/06/solve-libgfortran3dylib-not-found","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2016/06/solve-libgfortran3dylib-not-found"},{"title":"[Book] 最後的演講","text":"不論在工作上還是感情關係裡，就算自己居於主導地位，也絕對不能為所欲為 「就算你做在駕駛座上，也不表示你一定要輾過別人」 如果你發現自己某件事做得不好，可是卻沒有人告訴你，那可就糟了 你也許不喜歡聽到別人批評，可是你的批評者其實是在說他們仍然愛你，仍然關心你，希望你自己能夠變得更好 假動作 讓孩子去參予組織化的運動，通常不是希望他們真的精通那項運動 而是希望他們學到團隊合作、堅忍不拔、運動家精神、努力的價值，以及克服逆境的能力 阻礙我們前進的磚牆，不會無緣無故擋在我們前面。這種磚牆的存在目的不是為了把我們排除在外，而是要讓我們有機會證明自己多想要一件東西 計劃可以隨時改變，可是前提是必須先有計劃 讓團隊不必花時間再猜測對方在想什麼 「你永遠不用擔心我在想些什麼。不論好壞，我都一定會讓你知道我的想法」 「我如果沒說話，你就不必擔心」 讓別人把話說完 不要打斷別人的話。說話比較大聲或者比較快，不表示你的意見就比較好 不情不願或不真誠的道歉，通常比不道歉更糟糕，因為接受道歉的對方會覺得這種道歉是一種汙辱。草率的道歉就像是在傷口上灑鹽 典型惡例 「很抱歉我的行為讓你受傷。」( 這麼說表示你有意安輔對方的情緒，可是明顯可以看出你根本不打算彌合傷口 ) 「我為我的行為道歉，但你必須為你的行為向我道歉」( 這不叫道歉，這叫作要求對方道歉 ) 適當的道歉要有的要素 我做的事情是錯的 我對自己傷害到你感到很難過 我該怎麼做才能彌補過錯 開口問吧，不用怕。獲得肯定答案的機會，一定比你想像的還要頻繁。","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/06/the-last-lecture","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/06/the-last-lecture"},{"title":"[Book] 演算法統治世界","text":"演算法可以被視為由一連串二元決策構成的大型決策樹 我們所做的幾乎每件事，從開車到買賣股票乃至擇偶，都可以根據二元的輸入訊息被細分成一串二元決策 撰寫合乎常態分配的演算法比較容易，儘管歷史一再告訴世人，人類行為不能以正常視之，但一些駭客寧可只考慮常態分配 常態分配的假設可以在 100 天中賺 100 天，但是 1987 年的黑色星期五、1998 年的俄羅斯倒債危機以及 2010 年的閃電崩盤等都屬於第 101 天，可能毀了那些使用謹守高斯分配原則的演算法來做交易的人 就連高斯本人早在 200 多年前都曾警告世人，常態分配也可能發生各種強度不一的錯誤 創意工作者以為，緩緩蔓延的機器人革命碰不到他們，認為演算法無法創新，機器人不懂得創造 但我們現在漸漸知道，這些假設很危險 為何要讓優秀的人背負例行公事、詢問他這個領域的專家每天面對的案例？ 把疑難雜症留給優秀的人，把其他問題交給演算法 例如你上禮拜的感冒或者去年的鼻腔感染。演算法既便宜又精準，而且一天比一天聰明","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/05/automate-this-how-algorithms-came-to-rule-our-world","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/05/automate-this-how-algorithms-came-to-rule-our-world"},{"title":"[Book] 內向者的優勢","text":"與恐懼周旋 有意識地去感知恐懼 讓自己看清楚，為什麼你想做的事情是重要的，而且重要的即便心中恐懼也願意冒險 內向者經營單身生活的策略，下列是幾個值得參考的建議 每年嘗試一種新嗜好 每年兩次認識一個新地方 每兩週可以參觀一下展覽，或看看電影、舞台劇或舞蹈表演 每個月參與一場慶祝會或社交活動 藉由親自會面建立起來的人脈，動輒需要一兩年的時間，才能成為固定成員，並與他人建立穩定的互動，而且前提還是你的確很積極，掛名成員是產生不了什麼實質的互動 請在時間管理中預留固定的時段給數位人際互動。你該定期活動，盡可能每週一次以上。你可以發表文章、確認你認為合適的互動請求、讀一讀網頁上的留言，若有必要則回應一下。 這也表示：當你在進行其他活動時，不要因為一直顧著看推特的時間軸或臉書的留言而分心 當你身為會議主持人，請特別留意會場裡的內向者，他們可能需要較長的時間才願意表達意見，而且他們說起話來往往比外向的與會者小聲。設法讓這些內向者也能暢所欲言","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/04/leise-menschen-starke-wirkung","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2016/04/leise-menschen-starke-wirkung"},{"title":"[Book] 隨機騙局","text":"序：不必把知識看得那麼重 「有錢人想的跟你不一樣」點出百萬富翁跟一般人不同的一些特質 韌性和勤勞 就算所有的百萬富翁都是這樣的人，並不會使韌性跟勤勞的人變成百萬富翁 百萬富翁共同的特質可能還有冒險犯難 這是大獲成功的必要條件，也是失敗的必要條件 要是對破產公民做出相同的研究，他們肯定也是喜愛冒險犯難 前言：雲中的清真寺 所謂的「勇氣」可能是來自低估隨機性在某些事物佔有的份量 經濟「冒險者」比較像是某種錯覺的受害者，他們低估可能的不利結果，結果過度樂觀和自信 怪異的會計衡量方法 現實遠比俄羅斯輪盤惡毒 首先，它射出致命子彈的次數相當少。如果把現實比喻為左輪手槍，那麼它的彈夾能裝上千發，而不是六發。 試射了實際次都沒問題後，我們便會 產生虛假的安全感 ，忘了裡面還有一顆子彈 副現象 (epiphenomenalism): 看著你的風險，你能有效的降低風險 ? 還是你因此給自己一種感覺，覺得你已經盡了本份 ? 從組織的觀點來看，風險經理的存在，和為了實際降低風險比較沒有關係，和將低風險的印象比較有關係 用數學沈思歷史 在短暫的時間增量內，我們觀察到的是投資組合的變異性，不是報酬率。換言之，我們看到的是變異。一個人觀察到的，頂多就是變異和報酬的組合，不只是報酬 隨機性、胡說八道和科學知識份子 我們可能不需要什麼事都那麼理性和科學，只有在會傷害我們和威脅我們生存的狀況下，才需要 有趣的是，現代生活卻要我們做相反的事 談到宗教和個人行為等事物，我們變得極其實務和知性 談到由隨機性主宰的事物（e.g. 投資組合或不動產投資），卻盡可能的不用理性 最不適者生存 -

Speech content Don't outsource your future to a big institution. Figure it out yourself. It is large market share that matters instead of a big market. All happy companies are unique. The others are those who stuck in compete. Well defined, well differentiate jobs run away from big data or clouding XD What makes facebook valuable might not be purely social networking but real identity in social networking. Q&A Q: How to tell the different between crazy ideas and new ideas? It's hard to answer. Is the idea that no one does it or no one does it for good reason? Is it valuable and no others did it? Be honor yourself, don't be over-optimistic. Get to be the best in the world rather than best in Taipei or Taiwan. Q: Startup after having some working experience? It's true for business or management. Startup is something new and by definition, you will not learn from others. Thus, you might not be able to learn from working experience. Idea matters. Although management is important, when it compares to the new idea, it might be not that important. e.g., Twitter Somebody might say that they gonna startup 5 or 10 years later. However, that's rare. The fact is that most of these people would be stuck in many different problems and not that willing to take risks. There is no particular moment for one to startup. If you have a good idea, it's the time. Q: Why Thiel Fellowship support only drop-out students? It's stop-out instead drop-out. For one who wanna startup, full time working is needed. Q: Does there exist any character or special of entrepreneurs? Not easily give up, listen to others, and not to easily to be influenced. How well a team working together is important to a startup. The team members have to get along with each other. Thus, those who performs well in college aren't necessarily good entrepreneurs. Q: How to pick a startup team partner? No formula. It works best if you know they enough. Complementary skills and alike interests would be good. Q: Education problems. How about the flip classroom or MOOCS? It's education bubble. Peter cannot give an ultimate way to replace the university system. The suggestion is that don't get up the same or similar track. What makes education bubbles is that everyone treats university as church or religion. If you don't go into a college, your life would ruin. Such thought is the main problem. Q: How do startups in Taiwan get into the world and get resource? The first capital is the most difficult part and it's super difficult. This is the core challenge. Convincing people that your idea is real and gonna work is really hard. There are some great parts in Silicon Valley but also some bad parts. For example, office and hiring people there is expensive. Q: What the key point to convince peter to invest? ...... Q: Does Peter admire any other entrepreneurs? Mark Zuckerberg. ...... Q: Does Peter have any setback, failure? How to deal with that? It was the law school story wrote in the book. The interesting part is that this failure turns out to be not failure. Failure is overrated. The most important part of failure is not to give up.","tags":"Book","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2015/02/zero-to-one","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/book/2015/02/zero-to-one"},{"title":"vimspell - vim 檢查英文文法的套件","text":"vimspell 是一套提供 vim 根據字典來檢查文法的套件 有了 vimsepll，寫 Markdown 或 LaTeX 的時候，就不用再怕拼錯字了 用 vundle 安裝 在 vimrc 中加入下面這行 Bundle 'vimspell' 接著用 :BundleInstall 安裝 字典檔 下載字典檔 我下載的是 en_US.zip 解壓縮完後，用 vim 開啟街壓縮完的資料夾 應該會看到下面這樣 接著進入 vim 在 normal mode 輸入 : mkspell en en_US en 可以自己定義， en\\_US 必須是 .aff 和 .dic 的檔名 檢查一下 vim 資料夾下的 spell 資料夾有沒有新增字典檔，確定有了後就新增完成了 設定 首先要先定義要根據哪個字典檔 : set spelllang = en en 就是剛剛所定義的名稱 接著 :set spell 就可以開啟了 :set nospell 則是關閉 如果每次都要設定一次，就太麻煩了 我在 vimrc 加入了下面這些 set spelllang = en nmap < F7 > : setlocal spell !< cr > autocmd BufRead *.txt , *.md , *.tex setlocal spell 第二行是每次按 F7 就能開啟或關閉 vimspell，也可以換成自己想要的快捷鍵 第三行則是每次遇到副檔名是 txt, md, tex 時就自動開啟 vimspell 使用 vimspell 被開啟後，就會自動把拼錯的字反白起來 如果有其他的語言一樣會被反白起來 指令 ]s : 跳到下一個錯字 [s : 跳到上一個錯字 z= : 開啟建議，可以參考下面的圖，選擇完按 enter 後，就會替換原本的字 zg : 將目前游標上的字加入字典 新增的字都會被加到 ~/.vim/spell/en.utf-8.add ( 根據語言不同，檔名會不同 ) zug : 復原加入字典的字 (刪除) zw : 加入壞字字典，壞字也會被加入同樣的檔案中，最後面會另外加上 /! zuw : 復原加入壞字字典的字 (刪除) Reference Vim documentation: spell How to use spell check with vim [Reply] 如何在 vim 裡用拼字檢查 - iT 邦幫忙 ::IT 知識分享社群 Create a spell file for VIM vim - Automatically enabling spell checking in vimrc - Stack Overflow","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2015/02/vim-spell-check","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2015/02/vim-spell-check"},{"title":"gitignore.io","text":"每次開一個 git 專案，要為它找適當的 .gitignore，都要上網找模板蠻麻煩的 能不能有個簡單的方法，我開什麼專案就產生怎樣的 .gitignore 然後我就發現了 gitignore.io 簡單來說 gitignore.io 提供各式各樣的 gitignore，而且可以自動合併成一個 file 最棒的是它有提供 api 讓我們在 command line 上使用 gitignore.io on command 這是 gitignore.io 的官方文件 doc 設定 以 mac 的 zsh 的使用者為例，只要在執行下面這段 echo \"function gi() { curl -L -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/\\$@ ;}\" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc 或者在 ~/.zshrc 加入下面這段後，執行 source ~/.zshrc function gi () { curl -L -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/ $@ ; } 設定完成後就可以使用 gi 的功能 使用 基本上只有兩種用法 首先當然要先看 gi 支援哪些 .gitignore gi list 執行完會看到一長串的結果 actionscript,ada,agda,android... 接著在 gi 後面輸入想產生的 .gitignore 的 types gi \"types\" 如果有超過一個必須用 , 隔開 e.g., gi vim,osx 不過這樣還不會產生 .gitignore，只會顯示在螢幕上 還要再使用 output redirection 才會有 .gitignore gi vim,osx >> .gitignore My Custom gi 但用起來還是有點小小的不順手 尤其每次要看 list 都要重新連上網抓一次，挺浪費時間 所以就自己寫了一個新的 gi 我把它放在我的 GitHub 上 gi_extension 那我的 Custom gi 到底多支援了什麼呢？ 線下查看 gitignore.io 支援的類型，用更適合閱讀當方式印出 將 output redirection 寫成一個 option 支援以空格作為類型的分隔 ( 逗號依然支援 ) e.g., vim,osx → vim osx 安裝 git clone https://github.com/Lee-W/gi_extension && cd gi_extension sudo cp gi_extension.sh /usr/bin/gi 如果之前有在 shell 的設定檔中，設定過 gitignore.io 提供的 gi 記得要把它註解掉，不然那個 gi 會蓋過我的 gi 如果想移除掉 git clone https://github.com/Lee-W/gi_extension && cd gi_extension sudo rm gi_extension.sh /usr/bin/gi 使用 第一次使用的時候要先下 gi -u 將原本 gi list 的 output，儲存到 ~/.gi_list 顯示支援類型 以表格的方式輸出支援的類型 目前設定一個 row 容納 5 個 column，每個 column 長度為 25 gi -l 以字母的順序輸出 gi -L 顯示 .gitignore 的內容 跟原本的 gi 一樣，只是多支援了以空白作為分隔 gi \"types\" # e.g., gi vim osx 輸出 .gitignore 將結果加入目前資料夾下的 .gitignore gi -a \"types\" # e.g., gi -a vim osx 在目前的資料夾產生一份新的 .gitignore 取代舊有的 gi -e \"types\" # e.g.,e.g.,, gi -e vim osx 更新本地端的支援列表 gi -u 其實每次 gi 被執行的時候，都會在 backgroud 更新列表 但是這次的更新，下次才能被使用 所以如果想要強制更新就可以用上這個指令","tags":"Tech","url":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2015/02/gitignoreio","loc":"https://lee-w.github.io/posts/tech/2015/02/gitignoreio"},{"title":"[Book] 點子都是偷來的","text":"Steal Like an Artist - 10 Things Nobody Told You about Being Creatvie 所有的建言都只是經驗談 1.
